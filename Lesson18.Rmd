===Another Taste of PTC===


[[File:Step1.png|link=]]

[[File:Phenylthiocarbamide-3D-balls.png|link=|right|250px]]
The ability to taste the chemical Phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) is hereditary.  Some people can taste it, while others cannot.
Even though the ability to taste PTC was observed in all age, race, and sex groups, this does not address the issue about whether men or women are more likely to be able taste PTC.

Further exploration of the PTC data allows us to investigate if there is a difference in the proportion of men and women who can taste PTC. The following contingency table summarizes Elise Johnson's results<!--<cite>Johnson06</cite>-->:

{| class="basic" style="text-align:center"
|+ '''Gender Data Table'''
|-
! Can Taste PTC? || Female || Male || Total
|-
!  No
| 15 || 14 || 29
|-
! Yes
|| 51 || 38 || 89
|-
! Total
| 66 || 52 || 118
|-
|}

These data are available in the file <span class=Link>[[Data|PTCTasting]]</span>.  Note the way the data are organized in the file.  One column gives the gender, another column indicates if the individual can taste PTC, and a third column gives counts for each group.

Researchers want to know if the ability to taste PTC is a sex-linked trait. This can be summarized in the following research question: Is there a difference in the proportion of men and the proportion of women who can taste PTC?  The hypothesis is that there is no difference in the the true proportion of men who can taste PTC compared to the true proportion of women who can taste PTC.


[[File:Step2.png|link=]]

A sample of 66 females and 52 males were provided with PTC strips and asked to indicate if they could taste the chemical or not.  (This research was approved by the BYU-Idaho Institutional Review Board.)


[[File:Step3.png|link=]]

When working with quantitative data, it is natural to summarize the data by computing proportions. If someone has the ability to taste PTC, we will call this a success.  The sample proportion is defined as the number of successes observed divided by the total number of observations.  For the females, the proportion of the sample who could taste the PTC was:
$$
\hat p_1 = \frac{x_1}{n_1} = \frac{51}{66}
$$
This is approximately 77.3% of the people who were surveyed.  For the males, the proportion who could taste PTC was:
$$
\hat p_2 = \frac{x_2}{n_2} = \frac{38}{52}
$$
This works out to be about 73.1%.

When working with data for two proportions, graphically displaying the data can help us compare each proportion. Pie charts and bar charts are essential tools for describing our data.

[[File:Step4.png|link=]]

The null and alternative hypotheses for a test of equality of two proportions is:
$$
\begin{array}{rl}
H_0: & p_1 = p_2 \\
H_a: & p_1 \ne p_2 \\
\end{array}
$$

If the null hypothesis is true, then the proportion of females who can taste PTC is the same as the proportion of males who can taste PTC.

<span id="Equation"></span>
The test statistic is a $z$, and is given by:
$$
z = \frac{ \left( \hat p_1 - \hat p_2 \right) - \left( p_1 - p_2 \right) }{ \sqrt{\hat p \left( 1-\hat p \right) \left( \frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2} \right) } }
$$
where
$$
\begin{array}{lll}
n_1= \text{sample size for group 1:} 	& n_1 = 66 	& \text{(number of females)} \\
n_2= \text{sample size for group 2:}	& n_2 = 52	& \text{(number of males)} \\
\hat p_1= \text{sample proportion for group 1:} & \hat p_1 = \frac{x_1}{n_1} = \frac{51}{66} & \text{(proportion of females who can taste PTC)}\\
\hat p_2= \text{sample proportion for group 2:} ~ & \hat p_2 = \frac{x_2}{n_2} = \frac{38}{52} & \text{(proportion of males who can taste PTC)}\\
\hat p= \text{overall sample proportion:} 	& \hat p = \frac{x_1+x_2}{n_1+n_2} = \frac{89}{118} & \text{(overall proportion who can taste PTC)}\\
\end{array}
$$

Substituting these values into the equation for the test statistic, $z$, we get:
$$
\begin{align}
z & = \frac{ \left( \hat p_1 - \hat p_2 \right) - \left( p_1 - p_2 \right) }{ \sqrt{\hat p \left( 1-\hat p \right) \left( \frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2} \right) } }
\\
& = \frac{ \left( \hat p_1 - \hat p_2 \right) - \left( 0 \right) }{ \sqrt{\hat p \left( 1-\hat p \right) \left( \frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2} \right) } } \\
& ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \textrm{In the null hypothesis, we assumed that} ~ p_1=p_2. \\
& ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \textrm{Or after subtracting,} ~ p_1-p_2=0 \\
& ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \textrm{In the null hypothesis, we assumed that} ~ p_1=p_2. \\
& ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \textrm{So, we substituted} ~ 0 ~ \textrm{for} ~ p_1-p_2 ~ \text{in the previous step.} \\
& = \frac{ \left( \frac{51}{66} - \frac{38}{52} \right) - (0) }{ \sqrt{\frac{89}{118} \left( 1-\frac{89}{118} \right) \left( \frac{1}{66} + \frac{1}{52} \right) } } \\
& = 0.526 \\
\end{align}
$$

The test statistic is $z=0.526$. Under the null hypothesis, this follows a standard normal distribution.  So, we can use the Normal Probability applet to compute the $P$-value. We are conducting a two-sided test, so we will shade both tails in the applet.
<center>[[File:ShadeBothZ-0-5256.png|link=]]</center>
Since $P\textrm{-value} = 0.599 > 0.05 = \alpha$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.  In English we say, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the true proportion of males who can taste PTC is different from the true proportion of females who can taste PTC.


[[File:Step5.png|link=]]

Men and women appear to be able to taste PTC in equal proportions.  There is not enough evidence to say that one gender is able to taste PTC more than the other.
It appears that the ability to taste PTC is not a sex-linked trait.

===Mortality Rates and Day of Admission: Aortic Aneurysms===


Some people have claimed that mortality (death) rates are higher for patients admitted to a hospital on a weekend compared to patients admitted on a weekday.  Researchers Chaim Bell and Donald Redelmeier analyzed
admission data from hospital emergency rooms in Ontario, Canada <!--<cite>Bell01</cite>-->.

[[File:AneurysmAorta-marked.png|frame|center|link=|This CT scan image shows an abdominal aortic aneurysm. <br> The aorta is the large artery coming from the heart, along the center of the body. <br> The aneurysm appears as a bulge in the aorta. <br> (Image source: Michel de Villeneuve)]]

The aorta is a major artery that takes oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the entire body.  In some patients, this artery can swell like a balloon and burst.  If this occurs in the abdomen, the technical term for the event is a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Although this condition is treatable, it requires immediate action, or the patient will die rapidly.


[[File:Step1.png|link=]]

The problem is that the quality of care in an emergency care facility may differ at different times of the week.  Doctors Bell and Redelmeier hypothesized that the probability that a patient with an aortic aneurysm will die is greater if they are admitted to a hospital on a weekend compared to a weekday.


'''Hypothesis:'''
The proportion of patients with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm who will die is greater on the weekends than on weekdays.


[[File:Step2.png|link=]]

To test this claim, the researchers accessed medical records for several patients admitted to the emergency department of the hospitals in Ontario, Canada.  They recorded the number of patients admitted with an aortic aneurysm on weekdays compared to weekends.

Data representative of their results are given below <!--<cite>Bell01</cite>-->.

====Side-by-side Bar Charts====

If the data are considered counts, then a side-by-side bar chart is usually the preferred plot.

[[File:Step4.png|link=]]

{{Tip|$p_1$ is the true proportion of deaths in group 1, the weekday group.  $p_2$ is the true proportion of deaths in the weekend group.}}

We now conduct a formal hypothesis test to determine if the mortality (death) rate is greater on a weekend compared to a weekday.  First, we state the null and alternative hypotheses:
$$
\begin{align}
H_0: &  p_1 = p_2 \\
H_a: &  p_1 < p_2
\end{align}
$$
where group 1 represents the patients admitted on a weekday and group 2 represents patients admitted on a weekend.  Note that if $p_1 < p_2$, then the risk of death is greater in group 2 than in group 1. We will use the 0.05 level of significance.

====Checking Requirements for the Hypothesis Test====

{{Tip|When you check the requirements for this procedure, you are actually checking that you have at least 10 successes and 10 failures in both Group 1 and Group 2. All four conditions must be true in order to conduct the test.}}

If the sample size is large in both groups, then we can use the normal distribution to compute the $P$-value.  To check if the sample size is large enough, we need to check the following requirements:
$$
\begin{array}{rrr}
n_1 \cdot \hat p_1 \ge 10                 && n_2 \cdot \hat p_2 \ge 10 \\
n_1 \cdot \left(1-\hat p_1\right) \ge 10  && n_2 \cdot \left(1-\hat p_2\right) \ge 10
\end{array}
$$
If these requirements are satisfied, the $z$-statistic can be used to compute to assess whether the true population proportions are equal or if the risk of death is greater on weekends.

Note that the requirements are all satisfied:
$$
\begin{array}{rr}
n_1 \cdot \hat p_1  = 4145 \cdot 0.3561 = 1476 \ge 10  			& n_2 \cdot \hat p_2  = 1309 \cdot 0.4225 = 553 \ge 10  \\
n_1 \cdot \left(1-\hat p_1\right) = 4145 \cdot 0.6439 = 2669 \ge 10  	& n_2 \cdot \left(1-\hat p_2\right) = 1309 \cdot 0.5775 = 756 \ge 10
\end{array}
$$

{| class="basic"
|-
|
'''Reminder:''' $~ x_1 = 1476,~x_2 =553$, $n_1=4145,~n_2 = 1309$, $\hat p_1 = \frac{x_1}{n_1},~\hat p_2 = \frac{x_2}{n_2}$,
and $\hat p = \frac{x_1+x_2}{n_1+n_2}$.
|}

The test statistic can be computed by following these steps:

:*First, find the combined proportion of "successes."  This is computed as:
$$
\hat p = \frac{x_1+x_2}{n_1+n_2} = \frac{1476+553}{4145+1309} = \frac{2029}{5454}
$$
:*Next, enter the appropriate values into the equation for the $z$-score.
$$
\begin{array}{rcll}
z &=& \frac{ \left( \hat p_1 - \hat p_2 \right) - \left( p_1 - p_2 \right) }{ \sqrt{\hat p \left( 1-\hat p \right) \left( \frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2} \right) } } \\
&=& \frac{ \left( \hat p_1 - \hat p_2 \right) - \left( 0 \right) }{ \sqrt{\hat p \left( 1-\hat p \right) \left( \frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2} \right) } } & \text{We assumed } p_1=p_2. \\
&=& \frac{ \left( \hat p_1 - \hat p_2 \right) }{ \sqrt{\hat p \left( 1-\hat p \right) \left( \frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2} \right) } } \\
&=& \frac{ \left( \frac{1476}{4145} - \frac{553}{1309} \right) }{ \sqrt{\frac{2029}{5454} \left( 1-\frac{2029}{5454} \right) \left( \frac{1}{4145} + \frac{1}{1309} \right) } } \\
&=& -4.331
\end{array}
$$

(Make sure you can get this value using your calculator.)

<div class="Emphasis">
::'''Remember...'''

:The alternative hypothesis determines which area in the tails of the $z$-distribution will be shaded as you calculated the $P$-value.

:If the alternative hypothesis is $\ldots$

::*$p_1 \ne p_2$, shade both tails.

::*$p_1 < p_2$, shade the left tail.

::*$p_1 > p_2$, shade the right tail.
<br>
</div>

This $z$-score can be substituted into the Normal Probability applet to find the $P$-value.  Since the alternative hypothesis is that $p_1 < p_2$, we consider only the area to the left of $z=-4.331$.  The applet gives this area (our $P$-value) as $7.42 \times 10^{-6} = 0.00000742$.
<center>[[File:ShadeLeftZ-4-331.png|link=]]</center>
Note that $P$-value$ = 0.00000742 < 0.05 = \alpha$, so we reject the null hypothesis.


[[File:Step5.png|link=]]

There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the true proportion of patients who die from an aortic aneurysm is greater on the weekends than on the weekdays.  It appears that there are substantial differences in the quality of care available to patients on the weekends compared to patients on weekdays.

===Mortality Rates and Day of Admission: Heart Attacks===

Heart attacks are a leading cause of death in many areas of the world.
The study by Doctors Bell and Redelmeier included an analysis of the risk of dying of a heart attack, after admission to a hospital.  The researchers reported the following death rates, depending on whether the heart attack occurred on a weekday or a weekend <!--<cite>Bell01</cite>-->.


{| class="basic" style="text-align:center"
|+ '''Heart Attack Outcomes'''
! Outcome  !! Weekday Admission !! Weekend Admission

!Survived
| 100,596 || 36,222
|-
!Total (n)
| 117,709 || 42,511

In this section, you will conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the proportion of patients who die of a heart attack is greater on weekends than on weekdays. Use the 0.05 level of significance.

==Confidence Intervals: Managing Fox Populations==

{{:Lesson_18:Content/F2F}}

==Summary==

*When conducting hypothesis tests using two proportions, the null hypothesis is always $p_1=p_2$, indicating that there is no difference between the two proportions. The alternative hypothesis can be left-tailed ($<$), right-tailed($>$), or two-tailed($\ne$).

*For a hypothesis test and confidence interval of two proportions, we use the following symbols:
$$
\begin{array}{lcl}
\text{Sample proportion for group 1:} & \hat p_1 = \displaystyle{\frac{x_1}{n_1}} \\
\text{Sample proportion for group 2:} & \hat p_2 = \displaystyle{\frac{x_2}{n_2}}
\end{array}
$$

*For a hypothesis test only, we use the following symbols:

$$
\begin{array}{lcl}
\text{Overall sample proportion:} & \hat p = \displaystyle{\frac{x_1+x_2}{n_1+n_2}}
