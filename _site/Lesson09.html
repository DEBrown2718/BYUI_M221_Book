<p>A tragic accident on Lake George in New York, USA, called into question the safety regulations for commercial tour boats. On October 5, 2005, a full boat of 47 passengers and 1 crew member began a routine one-hour tour of Lake George. As the operator initiated a turn, the tour boat “Ethan Allen” listed (tipped) enough to take water aboard. The force caused by dipping beneath the surface caused the vessel to list, shifting the passengers to one side of the boat. After this shift in the weight distribution, the boat capsized killing 20 passengers and injuring 9 others.</p>
<p>[[<a href="File:Step1.png%7Clink" class="uri">File:Step1.png|link</a>=]]</p>
<p>We assume that at the time of the accident, the stability requirements were based on the Coast Guard criteria of a mean of 140 pounds per person. So, the Ethan Allen was supposed to be able to safely transport passengers and crew with a mean weight of 140 pounds. We want to investigate if 140 pounds is a reasonable value for the mean weight of tour boat passengers. This leads to the research question: “Is the mean weight of tour boat passengers greater than 140 pounds?”</p>
<p>We can rewrite the research question in a declarative sentence to obtain a hypothesis, or a testable statement about a population.</p>
<p>The first hypothesis we will write is that the Coast Guard criteria is appropriate: “The mean weight of tour boat passengers is 140 pounds.” We call this the null hypothesis. The ‘’’null hypothesis’’’ is a statement of the “status quo”, or the value typically considered to be appropriate. Notice that the null hypothesis is expressed with a statement involving equality (<span class="math inline">\(=\)</span>).</p>
<p>:<span class="math inline">\(H_0:~~\mu = 140\)</span> pounds</p>
<p>In contrast to the null hypothesis, we write the alternative hypothesis. This is typically the statement that a researcher suspects is the actual truth. In our case, we suspect that “The mean weight of tour boat passengers is greater than 140 pounds.”</p>
<p>:<span class="math inline">\(H_a:~~\mu &gt; 140\)</span> pounds</p>
<p>We label the null hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> and the alternative hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>. In every hypothesis test in this class, the null hypothesis will be a statement involving equality. The alternative hypothesis can include greater than (<span class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span>), less than (<span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>), or not equal (<span class="math inline">\(\ne\)</span>).</p>
<p>When we test hypotheses, we assume the null hypothesis is true. Because of this requirement, whenever we need to use μ in a calculation, we can use the value specified in the null hypothesis. When we conduct a hypothesis test, we gather evidence against the requirement that the null hypothesis is true. If we get enough evidence against the null hypothesis, we reject it. If we do not have sufficient evidence against the null hypothesis, we do not reject it.</p>
<p>[[<a href="File:Step2.png%7Clink" class="uri">File:Step2.png|link</a>=]]</p>
<p>How do we gather evidence against a null hypothesis? We collect data.</p>
<p>The marine accident report gives the weight (in pounds) of each of the passengers and the crew member. These values are reproduced below. <!-- [Cite: "Capsizing of New York State-Certificated Vessel Ethan Allen, Lake George, New York October 2, 2005"] --></p>

<p>[[<a href="File:Step3.png%7Clink" class="uri">File:Step3.png|link</a>=]]</p>
<p>To help us understand the the data, we first create a graph summarizing the values.</p>
<center>
‘’’Weights of Passengers and Crew on the Ethan Allen’’’<br> [[<a href="File:EthanAllen-PassengerWeights-Histogram.png%7Clink" class="uri">File:EthanAllen-PassengerWeights-Histogram.png|link</a>=]]
</center>
<p>Next, we compute summary statistics. The sample size is <span class="math inline">\(n=48\)</span>, and the sample mean is <span class="math inline">\(\bar x=177.6\)</span> pounds. According to the CDC, the standard deviation of the weights of individuals in the United States is $ =26.7$ pounds. <!-- CITE: http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/2000growthchart-us.pdf, page 154-155.--></p>
<p>Considering the data as a random sample of all possible tour boat passengers, it appears that the true mean weight of tour boat passengers might be greater than 140 pounds. However, we need to check this with a formal test of our hypotheses.</p>
<p>[[<a href="File:Step4.png%7Clink" class="uri">File:Step4.png|link</a>=]]</p>
<p>It is not sufficient to gain an intuitive sense for the data. We will test if there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the true mean weight of tour boat passengers is 140 pounds.</p>
<p>Assuming the null hypothesis is true, what is the probability that we would observe a sample mean as extreme or more extreme than the values we observed? This probability is called the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value.</p>
<p>To find the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value, we first calculate the number of standard deviations that <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> is away from the assumed value of true mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu=140\)</span> pounds. This is our <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score. Then we use the applet to determine the probability of observing a value of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> that is as large or larger than the value we observed.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \displaystyle{ z= \frac{ \bar x − \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{177.6−140}{26.7/\sqrt{48}}=9.757 } \]</span></p>
<p>We use the applet to determine the probability of observing a value of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> that is as large or larger than <span class="math inline">\(9.757\)</span>. This is the same as the probability of observing a value of $ x =177.6$ or more pounds, given that the true mean really is $ = 140$ pounds.</p>
<p>The area to the right of <span class="math inline">\(z=9.757\)</span> is so small, the normal probability applet gives the area as “1.7217e-22.” This is how a computer represents scientific notation. This number is actually <span class="math inline">\(1.7217x10^{-22}\)</span> or in other words, 0.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 172 17. This is the probability that a mean of <span class="math inline">\(\bar x=177.6\)</span> pounds was observed just by chance assuming the true mean is <span class="math inline">\(\mu = 140\)</span> lbs. This is very, very unlikely. A more plausible explanation is that the mean weight of individuals in the population is greater than 140 pounds.</p>
<p>Based on this analysis and the hypothesis test, the evidence against <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is strong enough to conclude that if every seat on the Ethan Allen was occupied, that the boat would be carrying a greater load than it was certified to handle.</p>
<p>[[<a href="File:Step5.png%7Clink" class="uri">File:Step5.png|link</a>=]]</p>
<p>As a result of this accident, the United States government took several actions. The Coast Guard stability regulations were changed, and the assumed average weight per person was increased to 185 pounds. <!-- [[CITE: http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg5212/docs/secg12142010.pdf]]--> As a result, the safety of public vessels has been improved. <!--

<p>==Body Temperatures of Healthy Adults==</p>
<p>===Introduction===</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered how it was determined that the true mean body temperature of healthy adults is 98.6° ?</p>
<p>It is not exactly clear who first reported this value, but this temperature has been used since the 1800’s. <!-- \cite{Mackowiak92,Horvath50} --> One of the most influential researchers in this area is Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich. He reported measuring over 1,000,000 body temperatures on over 20,000 patients.<!-- \cite{Mackowiak92,Wunderlich68} --> When the temperature is measured in the arm pit, it is called an axillary temperature measurement. Based on his research, Wunderlich stated, “The axillary temperature of 98.6° F = 37° C<span class="math inline">\(\ldots\)</span>is considered the central thermic point of health”. <!-- \cite{Wunderlich71}--> In other words, the mean body temperature of healthy adults is 98.6° F (or 37° C.)</p>

<p>===Data on Body Temperatures===</p>
<p>A group of researchers led by Philip A. Mackowiak, MD, conducted a study to assess the true mean body temperatures of healthy adults.<!-- \cite{Mackowiak92}--> They selected <span class="math inline">\(n=148\)</span> subjects between the ages of 18 and 40 years old, representative of the general population. Each volunteer was given a physical to assure that they were not ill at the time of the data collection. Their axillary body temperature was measured and reported in a paper published in the “Journal of the American Medical Association”. <!-- \cite{Mackowiak92}--> These data were extracted and are presented in the file <span class="Link">[[Data|BodyTemp]]</span>. The body temperatures in the file are given in degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>==Hypothesis Test for the True Mean Body Temperature==</p>
<p>===Null and Alternative Hypotheses===</p>
<p>It is commonly believed that the true mean body temperature is 98.6° F (37° C). In science, a statement or claim such as this is called a ‘’’hypothesis’’’. We can use data to test a hypothesis. If there is enough evidence against a hypothesis, we reject it in favor of something else.</p>
<p>The claim representing the “status quo” or the commonly held belief or the usual value is called the ‘’’null hypothesis’’’. In the case of body temperatures, our null hypothesis is defined by the belief that the true mean body temperature of healthy adults is 98.6° F.</p>
<p>We present the null hypothesis in the following way:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_0: \mu = 98.6\]</span></p>
<p>If we gather enough evidence against the null hypothesis and determine that it should be rejected, we need another hypothesis to propose in its place. This is called the ‘’’alternative hypothesis’’’. If 98.6° F is not the correct body temperature, then it is logical to propose the following alternative hypothesis:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_a: \mu \ne 98.6\]</span></p>
<p>To be brief in writing, we label the null hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. The zero in the subscript represents “null,” “baseline,” “default,” “no effect,” etc. Similarly, we label the alternative hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>.</p>
<p>Our alternative hypothesis could have been written as: :<em><span class="math inline">\(H_a: \mu \ne 98.6\)</span> (two-sided hypothesis; two-tailed) :</em><span class="math inline">\(H_a: \mu &lt; 98.6\)</span> (one-sided hypothesis; left-tailed) :*<span class="math inline">\(H_a: \mu &gt; 98.6\)</span> (one-sided hypothesis; right-tailed)</p>
<p>Notice that each of these is a viable alternative to the requirement that the mean is 98.6 degrees. We would only use <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span> if we had a belief in advance that the mean was less than or greater than 98.6. If we do not have a strong reason to believe the mean is either smaller or larger than the stated value–before we collect our data–then, we use <span class="math inline">\(\ne\)</span> in our alternative hypothesis.</p>
<p>It is important that the null and alternative hypotheses be determined prior to collecting the data. It is not appropriate to use the data from your study to choose the alternative hypothesis that will be used to test the same data! This is an example of using data twice, once to choose the test and again to conduct the test. It is okay to use data from a previous study to determine your null and alternative hypotheses, but it is an improper use of the statistical procedures to use the data to define ‘’and’’ conduct a hypothesis test.</p>
<p>Notice that the null and alternative hypotheses are statements about a population parameter (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>.) They will never involve a sample statistic (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span>.) Population parameters are unknown, and we are trying to make a judgement about whether or not they are equal to a particular value. Sample statistics are calculated from our data, so there is no reason to do any test to assess what their value is.</p>

<p>The null hypothesis will always be a statement involving equality. This gives us a starting point in our analysis. In the reading for [[Lesson 5: Normal Distributions|Normal Distributions]], we assumed that the true mean body temperature was 98.6° F. This becomes the assumed value of the mean of the distribution of the random variable <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span>.</p>
<p>The scientific method demands that we make a hypothesis (a claim or an educated guess). We assume that the null hypothesis is true and gather evidence against it. In other words, we “do research” (e.g., collect data) to gather evidence against that hypothesis. If we can gather enough evidence to discredit our initial hypothesis, we conclude that it was false, and begin the process again. If we are unable to reject the original hypothesis, we do not conclude that it is correct. For example, we do not know that Einstein’s Theory of Relativity is correct. We have simply not been able to disprove it<span class="math inline">\(\ldots\)</span>yet.</p>
<p>In the same way, we never can prove a null hypothesis is true. We can only gather evidence against it. If we get enough evidence, we reject the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>===Test Statistic===</p>
<p>Assuming the null hypothesis is true, we assume that the true mean body temperature of healthy adults actually is <span class="math inline">\(\mu = 98.6^{\circ}\)</span> F. Wanting to test this claim, researchers collected data on the mean body temperatures of <span class="math inline">\(n=148\)</span> healthy adults. The mean of the observed values was <span class="math inline">\(\bar x = 98.23^{\circ}\)</span> F.</p>
<p>A histogram of the body temperature data shows a nice bell-shaped distribution. Also, the sample mean, <span class="math inline">\(\bar x=98.23^\circ\)</span> F, appears to be reasonably close to the assumed population mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mu=98.6^\circ\)</span> F. However, it is important to remember that the standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{0.675}{\sqrt{148}}=0.055\)</span>. We need to determine how far <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> is from <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. Since we know <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> in this case, we can use the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score to determine if <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> is far from the assumed value. This is called the ‘’’test statistic’’’: <span class="math display">\[
z = \frac{\bar x - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{98.23 - 98.6}{0.675 / \sqrt{148}} = -6.6685
\]</span> Where <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is the test statistic, <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> is the sample mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the population mean, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is the standard deviation and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the sample size. Based on the results from the formula above, <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> is over 6 standard deviations below the mean!</p>
<p>===<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value===</p>
<p>====Definition====</p>
<p>The ‘’’<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value’’’ is the probability of obtaining a test statistic (such as <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>) at least as extreme as the one you calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In other words, our <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is the probability that we would get a <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score that is as extreme or more extreme than <span class="math inline">\(z=-6.6685\)</span>, assuming the true mean is 98.6° F.</p>
<p>In advance of collecting the data, we may have had no idea whether the true mean would be greater than 98.6 or less than 98.6, if 98.6° F was not the right value. This is why we used a two-sided alternative hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_a: \mu \ne 98.6\)</span>.) When computing the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value, we need to continue this logic. So, we would have considered a value of <span class="math inline">\(z=-6.6685\)</span> to be equally as extreme as <span class="math inline">\(z=6.6685\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the case of a two-sided test for one mean with <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> known, the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is the area in the tails beyond <span class="math inline">\(\pm z\)</span>, in both the left and right tails of the standard normal distribution.</p>
<p>[[<a href="File:Applet2584E-11-twosided-LoR.png%7Clink" class="uri">File:Applet2584E-11-twosided-LoR.png|link</a>=|center]]</p>
<p>Using the applet, we shade the area in both tails and then type in the value of <span class="math inline">\(z=-6.669\)</span>. The applet reports an area of “2.584E-11.” This is the way computers indicate scientific notation. Expressed using more traditional notation, we get</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P\text{-value} = 2.584 \times 10^{-11} = 0.000~000~000~026 \]</span></p>
<p>You should always convert the computer’s notation involving “E” to scientific notation or decimal notation.</p>
<div class="Emphasis">
<p>:‘’’Scientific Notation:’’’<br> ::Scientific notation is a method used to write very large or very small numbers without a lot of extra zeros. Computers express scientific notation using the letter “E.” For example, to write <span class="math inline">\(7.8\times 10^3\)</span>, a computer would output the expression 7.8E3. For example, the number <span class="math inline">\(7.8\times 10^3\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(7.8 \times 1000=7300\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\(10^3 = 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 = 1000\)</span>. Another way to think of this is to move the decimal place in the number 7.8 three places to the right, which gives you <span class="math display">\[ 7~\underset{\rightarrow}{8} \underset{\rightarrow}{0} \underset{\rightarrow}{0}. \]</span><br />
::This is an example of how very large numbers can be represented. To express small numbers (close to zero,) we use negative exponents. The number <span class="math inline">\(9.12 \times 10^{-5}\)</span> is the same as <span class="math inline">\(9.12 \times (10^5)^{-1} = 9.12 \times (10000)^{-1}\)</span>. This can be written as <span class="math inline">\(9.12 \times 0.00001 = 0.0000912\)</span>. Since the exponent on the 10 is <span class="math inline">\(-5\)</span>, you move the decimal place in the number 9.1 five places to the left: <span class="math display">\[0.\underset{\leftarrow}{0}\underset{\leftarrow}{0}\underset{\leftarrow}{0}\underset{\leftarrow}{0}\underset{\leftarrow}{9}~1~2\]</span> ::Similarly, the value <span class="math inline">\(2.57552 \times 10^{-11}\)</span> can be written in regular notation as <span class="math inline">\(0.000~000~000~025~755~2\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>If the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is small, that implies that the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score was very large (far away from 0.) In other words, <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> was far away from <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. In this case, our <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score was 6.669 standard deviations below the mean. It is very unusual to get a value of <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> that is this far from the value of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> given in the null hypothesis. This implies that it is not plausible that the mean is equal to 98.6° F. We reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient evidence that the true mean body temperature of healthy adults is not 98.6° F.</p>
<p>If this conclusion is correct, you may wonder why so many people think the true mean body temperature of healthy adults is 98.6° F (37° C). Good question!</p>
<p>====Relationship to the Alternative Hypothesis====</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is determined using the alternative hypothesis. If the alternative hypothesis is two-sided (i.e. if the alternative hypothesis involves <span class="math inline">\(\ne\)</span>,) then the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is the area in the tails further than <span class="math inline">\(\pm z\)</span>. That is, it is the area to the left of <span class="math inline">\(z=-6.669\)</span> plus the area to the right of <span class="math inline">\(z=+6.669\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the alternative hypothesis involves less than (such as <span class="math inline">\(\mu&lt;98.6\)</span>,) we call it a left-tailed test. For a left-tailed test, the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is the area under the standard normal curve to the left of the test statistic, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the case of a right-tailed test, the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is the area to the right of the test statistic, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>.</p>
<p>The three possibilities are illustrated in the figures below.</p>

<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> is close to <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, then the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score will be small. If the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score is small, then there will be a lot of area in the tails beyond <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. In other words, the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value will be large. These two possibilities are illustrated for a two-tailed test in the figure below. Similar results hold for a one-tailed test.</p>

<p>In the case of the body temperatures, a large <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score (<span class="math inline">\(z=-6.669\)</span>) led to a small <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value (the area in the tails.) We observed a value for <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> that was very far from <span class="math inline">\(\mu=98.6\)</span>. Strictly due to chance, it would be very unlikely to observe a mean of <span class="math inline">\(\bar x=98.23^\circ\)</span> F in a random sample of <span class="math inline">\(n=148\)</span> if the true mean is 98.6° F.</p>
<p>===Level of Significance, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>===</p>
<p>How do we decide if the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is small enough to reject the null hypothesis? We need a way to determine if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that does not depend on the data. We need a number that can be used to determine if the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is small enough to reject the null hypothesis. This number is called the ‘’’level of significance’‘’ and is often denoted by the symbol’‘’<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>’’’ (pronounced “alpha”.)</p>

Some students find it helpful to remember the decision rule using the couplet: <br> |- align=“center” | “If the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is low,<br> Reject the null.” |}
</center>
<p>We will use the same decision rule for all hypothesis tests. If the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is less than <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, we reject the null hypothesis. Conversely, if the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is greater than <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. The level of significance, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, must be chosen prior to collecting the data. This is our standard for determining if the null hypothesis should be rejected. It is important that the personal bias of the researcher is not imposed on the data. So, we choose the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> level prior to collecting the data. If we wanted to reject the null hypothesis, we could compute the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value and then unscrupulously choose the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> level. In every case, we could choose a value of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> that is larger than the computed <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value, and therefore always reject the null hypothesis. This practice would defeat the purpose of hypothesis testing.</p>
<p>===Type I and Type II Errors===</p>
<p>If the null hypothesis is true, for example, if the true body temperature of healthy adults is really 98.6° F, sometimes we will get a very large or very small value of <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span>. This will lead to a very extreme <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score, strictly due to chance. In this case, we would reject the null hypothesis, even though it is true!</p>
<p>Whenever we reject a true null hypothesis, we say that a ‘’’Type I error’’’ was committed. Assuming the null hypothesis is true, the level of significance (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>) is the probability of getting a value of the test statistic that is extreme enough that the null hypothesis will be rejected. In other words, the level of significance (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>) is the probability of committing a Type I error.</p>
<p>We choose <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> to be some small number so that the probability of committing a Type I error is low. The most common value for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span>. This is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{20}\)</span>. So, when the null hypothesis is true, there is a one-in-twenty chance that it will be rejected at the 0.05 level of significance. Other common choices for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> include <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.01\)</span>.</p>

<p>If the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> value (the probability of committing a Type I error) is very small, the probability of committing a Type II error will be large.

<p>===Requirements===</p>
<p>Certain requirements are required for us to conduct the hypothesis test for a single mean with <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> known.</p>
<p>First of all, we must assume that the data represent a simple random sample from a large population. In practice, this requirement is rarely satisfied. Frequently researchers working with humans rely on convenience samples, where the subjects volunteer to participate in a research project. The researcher may advertise using television, radio, and flyers in a clinic. If there is no relationship between the issue being studied and people’s desire to participate, this method works fairly well.</p>
<p>A second requirement is that the data are drawn from a population that has a normal distribution with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> given in the null hypothesis (e.g. 98.6° F) and a known standard deviation (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(\sigma=0.675^\circ\)</span> F.)</p>
<p>It turns out that the procedure actually works quite well–even if the data are not normally distributed–as long as <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> follows a normal distribution. Under what conditions will <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> be normally distributed? (Think about it.)</p>
<p>In the reading for [[Lesson 6: Distribution of Sample Means &amp; The Central Limit Theorem|Distribution of Sample Means &amp; The Central Limit Theorem|Lesson 6]], we learned that <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> will follow a normal distribution if the data are drawn from a normal distribution or if the sample size (<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>) is large.</p>
<p>Putting this all together, we can summarize the requirements for a test for a single mean with <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> known as: :<em>The data represent a simple random sample from a large population. :</em>The sample mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> is normally distributed. This happens if either one of the following is true: ::<em>The population is normally distributed. ::</em>The sample size is large.</p>

<p>==Worked Example: Perceived Health after a Cardiac Arrest==</p>
<p>A group of researchers led by Dr. Jared Bunch studied the long-term effects suffered by patients who experienced a cardiac arrest outside a hospital<!-- \cite{Bunch03} -->. The long-term health of the patients was assessed using the Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36)<!-- \cite{Ware92} --> at the time of their last follow up visit. The SF-36 is normalized so the mean score in the general population is <span class="math inline">\(\mu=50\)</span> and the standard deviation is <span class="math inline">\(\sigma=10\)</span><!-- \cite{Jenkinson99} -->. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 100. Lower scores on the SF-36 indicate a poorer quality of health.</p>
<p>Using the 0.05 level of significance, we will conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the mean perceived general health level among cardiac arrest survivors is less than 50. In other words, we want to know if the mean perceived overall health is lower among cardiac arrest survivors than in the general population.</p>
<p>Dr. Bunch summarized the responses in a figure, <!--\cite{Bunch03}--> from which the data were extracted. These data are given in the file <span class="Link">[[Data|CardiacArrestHealth]]</span>.</p>

<p>==Requirements==</p>
<p>There are three requirements that need to be checked when conducting a hypothesis test for a mean with <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> known:</p>
<p>:1. A simple random sample was drawn from the population :2. $ x$ is normally distributed :3. $ $ is assumed to be known</p>
<p>It is rare for the first requirement to be satisfied in practice. If the results are to generalize to the population, the sample needs to be representative of the whole population. This is accomplished through random sampling.</p>
<p>The second requirement is satisfied if (a) the raw data are normally distributed or (b) the sample size is large. In practice, these tests tend to be fairly robust when the requirement of normality is violated. Even if the requirement of normality is not satisfied perfectly, it is usually okay to conduct the test.</p>
<p>In practice, we never really know $ $. This procedure is primarily used to help you understand how to conduct a hypothesis test. When we do not know <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, there is a slightly different procedure, which you will learn soon.</p>

<p>===Mean GPA of early risers===</p>
<p>In Doctrine and Covenants 88:124, the Lord commands, “…cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.” Are there academic benefits from obeying this commandment? People who sleep late tend to be stereotyped as slackers. It is not fair to make these claims without any scientific evidence. The purpose of this study is used to address whether early risers earn better grades.</p>
<p>Researcher K. Clay and others presented a paper at the Associated Professional Sleep Societies meeting [4]. They suggested that the mean GPA of students who are early risers tends to be higher than average. The mean grade point average (GPA) of all students at BYU-Idaho is $ = 3.15 $. The population standard deviation for the grades of students at BYU-Idaho is $ = 0.68$.</p>
<p>A simple random sample of $n = 378 $ early-rising BYU-Idaho students was collected. The students were asked to report their BYU-Idaho GPA. The GPA of each person who was selected and signed the informed consent statement (to authorize the use of their data) was recorded.</p>

<p>::: A simple random sample of <span class="math inline">\(n = 378\)</span> early-rising students at BYU-Idaho was collected. Both the histogram and the Q-Q plot suggest that the data are left-skewed. That is, many of the students have fairly high GPAs, but a few are very low. It is reasonable to conclude that the mean of the GPAs are approximately normally distributed, since the sample size is large, even though the GPA data are left-skewed.</p>

<p><span class="math display">\[ \displaystyle{ z = \frac{\bar x - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{3.21-3.15}{0.68/\sqrt{378}} = 1.7155 } \]</span></p>

<p>:10. State your decision</p>
<p>::: Reject Ho. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the mean GPA of early risers is greater than <span class="math inline">\(3.15\)</span>.</p>

<p>:11. Present your conclusion in an English sentence, relating the result to the context of the problem</p>
<p>::: It is reasonable to conclude that the mean GPA of early risers is greater than <span class="math inline">\(3.15\)</span>. This suggests that there may be some benefit to getting out of bed early in the morning.</p>
<p>===Summary===</p>
<p>The previous three examples illustrate the three types of alternative hypotheses: two-tailed, left-tailed and right-tailed. In each case, the structure of the hypothesis test is basically the same. However, when the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score is entered into the applet to compute the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value, it is important to note whether to shade both tails, the left tail, or the right tail of the standard normal or (<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>) distribution.</p>

<p>===U.S. Criminal Justice System===</p>
<p>In the United States criminal justice system, when a person is accused of a crime, they are assumed innocent until proven guilty. This is analogous to the requirement that the null hypothesis is true until we gather enough evidence to reject it.</p>
<p>A judge or a jury must plant in their mind the requirement of innocence. At the end of the trial, they must determine if there is enough evidence to determine “”beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; that the person is guilty. If this standard is met, the judge/jury rejects the requirement of innocence and declares the defendant “guilty.” However, if there is not enough evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty, the judge/jury fails to reject the requirement of innocence and returns a verdict of “not guilty.”</p>
<p>The judge/jury originally assumed the defendant was innocent, so they cannot conclude that the person is “innocent” at the end of the trial. It is not possible to start with the requirement of innocence and logically used that requirement in the proof of itself.</p>
<p>===Why Don’t we Accept the Null Hypothesis?===</p>
<p>It may be hard, but imagine for a moment that <span class="math inline">\(1=2\)</span>. Even though it goes against everything you thought was true in Mathematics, relax your mind and assume that <span class="math inline">\(1=2\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(1=2\)</span>, then we can apply valid algebraic operations to both sides of this equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{rcll}
1 &amp;=&amp; 2     &amp; \leftarrow \textrm{Assumed true} \\
1(2) &amp;=&amp; 2(2)  &amp; \leftarrow \textrm{Multiply both sides by 2} \\
2 &amp;=&amp; 4     &amp; \leftarrow \textrm{Simplify} \\
2-3 &amp;=&amp; 4-3   &amp; \leftarrow \textrm{Subtract 3 from both sides} \\
-1 &amp;=&amp; 1     &amp; \leftarrow \textrm{Simplify} \\
(-1)^2 &amp;=&amp; (1)^2 &amp; \leftarrow \textrm{Square both sides} \\
1 &amp;=&amp; 1     &amp; \leftarrow \textrm{Simplify}
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>We started with an requirement that <span class="math inline">\(1=2\)</span> is a true statement. We applied valid algebraic operations at each step. In the end, we found that <span class="math inline">\(1=1\)</span>, which is certainly no contradiction. Logically, have we shown that <span class="math inline">\(1=2\)</span>?</p>
<div class="QuestionsHeading">
Answer the following question:
</div>
<div class="Questions">
<p>:32. What is wrong with the logic in this “proof?”</p>
<div style="clear:both">

</div>
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" data-collapsetext="Hide Solution" data-expandtext="Show Solution">
<p>::The problem here is that we assumed that <span class="math inline">\(1=2\)</span>, and then we attempted to use that requirement to prove itself. We cannot use a requirement as evidence of itself. ::However, if we start with an requirement and then find a contradiction, then we know that our original requirement is not true. Since this did not happen, we say that we did not get enough evidence against the requirement that <span class="math inline">\(1=2\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>In science, we make a hypothesis (or a statement or claim) and then we gather evidence “against” that requirement. If we cannot reject the hypothesis, In the mathematical example above, we started with an requirement and did not find sufficient evidence against that requirement. In the end, we arrived at no contradiction at all: <span class="math inline">\(1=1\)</span>. This did not mean that our original claim that <span class="math inline">\(1=2\)</span> was true; it only meant that we had not yet disproved it. We could not reject the original claim.</p>
<p>We have to be careful when conducting hypothesis tests. When we conduct a test, we assume the null hypothesis is true. This provides a distribution for the test statistic, and allows us to calculate the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value. If we find that the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is large, that means that we did not find a contradiction in our requirement that the null hypothesis is true. That does not mean that the null hypothesis is true, it only means that we cannot reject it. For this reason, we never say we “accept the null hypothesis.” When the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is large, we say that we “fail to reject the null hypothesis.”</p>
<p>===Testimonies and Hypothesis Tests===</p>
<p>The scientific method demands that we make a hypothesis (a claim or an educated guess). We then “do research” (e.g., collect data) to gather evidence against that hypothesis. If we can gather enough evidence to discredit our initial hypothesis, we conclude that it was false, and begin the process again.</p>
<p>If we are unable to reject the original hypothesis, we do not conclude that it is correct. For example, just because apples have always been observed to fall downward out of apple trees, we do not conclude that the Law of Gravity is correct. However, it has not been disproved either.</p>
<p>This philosophy is very different from the way one gains a testimony. A testimony is a Gift of the Spirit, and it is given only by revelation.</p>

For verily I say unto you, they are given for the benefit of those who love me and keep all my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do; that all may be benefited that seek or that ask of me, that ask and not for a sign that they may consume it upon their lusts. And again, verily I say unto you, I would that ye should always remember, and always retain in your minds what those gifts are, that are given unto the church. For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God. To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby. To some it is given by the Holy Ghost to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that he was crucified for the sins of the world. To others it is given to believe on their words, that they also might have eternal life if they continue faithful. <br> (Doctrine and Covenants 46:8-14) |}
</center>
<p>We cannot demand or try to force a gift of the Spirit, or we make ourselves susceptible to deception. We can only obey, ask, exercise faith, and wait upon the Lord.</p>
<p>When the gift of a true testimony is given, it does not provide evidence against a hypothesis, rather it establishes the truth in the heart of the recipient. A testimony does not follow the scientific method. A testimony does not provide evidence against some claim, rather it is the (final) establishment of the truth.</p>
<p>Testimonies need to be nourished, and if neglected, they will perish. They can be fragile.</p>
<p>When a testimony is given, the truth is planted in the heart. The testimony from the Holy Ghost makes additional “scientific” inquiry unnecessary. No additional information can be gained by “testing” a testimony using the scientific method.</p>
