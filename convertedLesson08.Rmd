2. What is the name of the important statistical result that states that when the sample size is large, the sample mean $\bar x$ will be close to the population mean $\mu$?


3. Which of the following variables is/are categorical?

- The number of animals in the local zoo
- A randomly selected brand of toothpaste at a convenience store
- Age in years of a randomly selected vehicle in a parking lot


4. The mean I.Q. test score in the United States is 100. Twenty randomly selected Statistics students took an I.Q. test, and the mean of their scores was 112. Which of these two numbers is a parameter and which is a statistic?


5. Rotham City has four distinct neighborhoods.  The property values are very similar within each neighborhood, but they vary considerably from neighborhood to neighborhood.  One neighborhood has very low property values and another has extremely high property values.  Property taxes are usually roughly proportional to the property values.  What type of sample should we collect to gauge the residents' responses to a proposed increase in property taxes?


6. When designed experiments are conducted in public school systems, researchers typically choose a particular district, and randomly select teachers of, say, fourth grade students in that district.  The experiment is then conducted using all the students in the selected classes. Which type of sampling scheme is implemented?


7. At a school fund raiser, the name of every person who attended was entered into a drawing.  At the end of the evening, six names were selected to receive door prizes. Which type of sampling scheme was implemented?


8. A special interest group is conducting a survey regarding wolves in Yellowstone National Park.  To adequately gauge opinions on both sides of the political spectrum, the researchers took the list of registered Democrats and selected a simple random sample of 100 people.  Then, they took a list of registered Republicans and selected a simple random sample of 100 people. Which type of sampling scheme was implemented?


A survey was taken of purchases at the Crossroads.  Open the data file [CrossroadsPurchases](http://statistics.byuimath.com/index.php?title=Data){target="_blank"} 
and use this data to answer questions 9 and 10.

10. Create a histogram representing the amounts spent in Crossroads purchases.


Jessica Meir and her research team measured the body temperatures of a sample of diving elephant seals.<!-- \cite{Meir10} -->  A thermistor was placed at a specific location on each seal to measure its body temperature.  The body temperature of seals tends to decrease as they dive.  The researchers estimated the typical body temperature of each seal at the time they initiate a dive and called this the "representative temperature" of the seal.

Thermistors were placed in the hepatic sinus of four of the seals (named Bodil, Roberta, Larry, and Per.)  The seal's body temperature at the start of the dive was calculated to be:

<table>

<tr class="header">
<th><p>Seal</p></th>
<th><p>Representative<br />

16. In the same study, the researchers placed thermistors (temperature sensors) in the three seals (named Chick, Starburst, and Patty) near their spinal cord and brain in the extradural vein.  They placed thermistors in six other seals (named Sir Richard, Jerry, Sammy, Knut, Jonesie, and Butler) in their aorta, the largest artery in the body. Finally, they placed thermistors in four other seals (named Bodil, Roberta, Larry, and Per) in their hepatic sinus. The results from this study are summarized in the table below.

18. Give the five-number summary of this data.


19. What percentage of the data lies between 4 hours and 8 hours?


An observation from a normally distributed population is considered "unusual" if it is more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean.  There are several contaminants that can harm a city's water supply.  Nitrate concentrations above 10 ppm (parts per million) are considered a health risk for infants less than six month of age.  The City of Rexburg reports that the nitrate concentration in the city's drinking water supply is between 1.59 and 2.52 ppm (parts per million,) and values outside of this range are unusual. We will assume 1.59 ppm is the value of $\mu-2\sigma$ and $\mu+2\sigma$ is equal to 2.52 ppm.  It is reasonable to assume the measured nitrate concentration is normally distributed.
<!-- (Source:  \texttt{http://www.rexburg.org/departments/publicworks/pdfs/waterQuality2007.pdf}) -->
Use this information to answer questions 20 through 22.

20. Estimate the mean of the measured nitrate concentration in Rexburg's drinking water.


21. Estimate the standard deviation of the measured nitrate concentration in Rexburg's drinking water.


22. Between what two measured nitrate concentrations do approximately 68% of the data values lie?


23. What is the mean and standard deviation of the standard normal distribution?


The admissions committees for most masters of business administration (MBA) programs require the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) as part of the application for new students. It has been shown that the scores on the GMAT are normally distributed with a mean of 542.3 and a standard deviation of 120.54. <!-- (Source: www.mba.com.) --> The minimum GMAT score required for admission to the MAcc program in the School of Accountancy at BYU is 500, but it is rare for students with scores less than 600 to be admitted. <!-- (Source: http://marriottschool.byu.edu/soa/macc/admission.cfm.) -->
Use this information to answer questions 24 through 32.

24. What is the probability that a randomly selected student will score above 542.3 on the GMAT? 


25. What is the probability that a randomly selected student will score below 600 on the GMAT?


26. What is the probability that a randomly selected student will score 600 or above on the GMAT?


27. Find the GMAT score that corresponds to the 10th percentile.


28. Find the GMAT score that corresponds to the 90th percentile.


29. Find the first quartile of the distribution of GMAT scores.


30. Find the third quartile of the distribution of GMAT scores.


Consider a simple random sample of $n=15$ students taking the GMAT.   


31. What are the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of sample mean scores for all such samples?


32. What is the probability that the sample mean GMAT score for a SRS of $n=15$ students will be greater than 600?
