At this point, it may be difficult to understand the meaning and usefulness of the standard deviation.  For now, it is enough for you to recognize the following points:

  +  The standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the data are.
  +  If the standard deviation is large, then the data are very spread out.
  +  If the standard deviation is zero, then all the values are the identical--there is no spread in the data.
  +  The standard deviation cannot be negative.
