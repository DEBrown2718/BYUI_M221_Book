<p>==Example of Paired Data: Pre- and Post-test Scores==</p>
<p>In education, it is very common for researchers to conduct studies in which they administer a pre-test, provide some instruction, and then give a post-test. The difference between the post- and pre-test scores is a measure of the student’s progress. In this case, it would not make much sense to only look at the mean score on the pre-test and compare it to the mean score on the post-test.</p>
<p>This is called a ‘’’matched-pairs’‘’ design or we say we have’‘’dependent samples’‘’. Matched-pairs (or’‘’paired-data’’’) designs typically involve only one population, and a pair of observations is drawn on the individuals selected for the sample. In the context of the educational study, the two observations are student’s scores on (1) the pre-test and (2) the post-test. If a student is selected to participate in the pre-test (i.e., they are selected to be part of group 1), they are automatically selected to participate in the post-test (i.e., they are chosen to be in group 2 automatically.)</p>
<p>There is a lot of merit in subtracting the individual scores and looking at the mean ‘’gain’‘. The researchers are not really interested in the students knowledge before the instruction. This is used as a baseline to measure how much was gained during the instruction. There is great value in looking at the difference. This removes the effect of the individual students’ ability, and it measures their learning during the unit.</p>
<p>To analyze the data, the researchers first find the difference in the post- and pre-test scores. At that point, the data have been reduced to a list of numbers (representing the increase in scores.) Now, the researchers can conduct inference on the mean of these values. In other words, they can do a hypothesis test for the mean of the difference in the post- and pre-test scores.</p>
<p>A hypothesis test for two means with paired data (dependent samples) is conducted in the same way as a hypothesis test for a single mean with <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> unknown. The only exception is that the pairs of data must be subtracted before you start any computations. From a practical perspective, after you subtract, then you apply the one-sample procedures you have already learned. So, there is nothing new that you need to learn to compute a confidence interval for two means with paired data…except how to subtract in {{Name}}.</p>
<p>We will first explore an application of pre- and post-testing in a weight loss study.</p>

<p>===Mahon’s Weight Loss Study===</p>
<p>‘’’Background’’’</p>
<p>Annie Mahon and other researchers in Wayne Campbell’s nutrition lab studied the weight loss of <span class="math inline">\(n=27\)</span> middle aged women who consumed a prescribed low-calorie diet. <!--<cite>Mahon07</cite>--> The women’s weights were recorded (in kilograms) at the beginning of the study and after the nine-week diet period. The data are given in the file <span class="Link">[[Data|Mahon]]</span>. An excerpt of the data is given below.</p>
<p>{| class=“basic” ! Subject !! Pre !! Post |- |1 || 62.5 || 56.1 |- |2 || 88.8 || 80.2 |- |3 || 74.7 || 70.8 |- |<span class="math inline">\(\vdots\)</span> || <span class="math inline">\(\vdots\)</span> || <span class="math inline">\(\vdots\)</span> |- |26 || 76.3 || 73.8 |- |27 || 82.1 || 77.9 |- |}</p>
<p>Notice the structure of the data. The weight of each subject was measured before the study and at the conclusion of the study. Each person provided a pre-study weight and a post-study weight. Stated differently, the pre-study weights and the post-study weights are paired. For each row of data, both of these numbers came from the same person. When we collect two observations of the same measurement on each subject, we call it ‘’’paired data’‘’. Sometimes paired data are called’‘’dependent samples’’’.</p>
<div class="QuestionsHeading">
Answer the following question:
</div>
<div class="Questions">
<p>:1. The researchers measured the initial weights of the women prior to the study, even though they were not particularly interested in this value. What was the purpose of measuring the pre-study weights?</p>
<div style="clear:both">

</div>
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" data-collapsetext="Hide Solution" data-expandtext="Show Solution">
<p>::The goal of the study is to determine how much the women’s weight change as as result of the study. The researchers must measure the women’s weights at the beginning of the study, so they can subtract the initial (pre-study) weight of each woman from her final (post-study) weight.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>‘’’Computing New Variables in {{Name}}’’’</p>
<p>Annie Mahon and her research team are interested in the difference of the weights after the study compared with before: <span class="math display">\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Post} - \text{Pre} \]</span></p>
<p>Appending the column of differences to the table above, we have:</p>
<p>{| class=“basic” ! Subject !! Post !! Pre !! Difference |- | 1 || 56.1 || 62.5 || 56.1 <span class="math inline">\(-\)</span> 62.5 = -6.4 |-<br />

<p>The researchers are not interested in the weights of the women, they are more interested in the ‘’change’’ in the women’s weights. This will give them a measure of the effectiveness of the low-calorie diet. Notice that in this weight loss study, the change in the weights is negative. This indicates that the final weight was lower than the initial weight.</p>

</div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>‘’’Relationship to a One Sample t-test’’’</p>
<p>After you have subtracted the pre-study weights from the post-study weights, you are left with a column of differences. We will denote the pre-study weights by $ x_1 $ and the post-study weights by $ x_2 $. Then, the differences can be denoted as $ d = x_2 - x_1 $. The difference, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, is defined as the change in the volunteer’s weight during the study.</p>
<p>After computing the differences, we do not use the data for the individual groups at all. The researchers are not interested in the values of the women’s weights at the beginning of the study or at the end of the study. They are mostly interested in the difference in the weights after the participants complete the study.</p>
<p>After we subtract, we can conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the mean of the differences is less than zero. We use the symbol $ _d $ to represent the true mean difference in the weights of the women who follow the diet prescribed in this study. The null hypotheses is that the true mean difference is zero (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_d = 0\)</span>). The alternative hypothesis is that there is a decrease in the weights, in other words, that the true mean difference is less than zero (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_d &lt; 0\)</span>).</p>
<p>Notice that this is essentially a one-sample t-test where the data are the differences in the women’s weights. We have one column of data, the differences. We are testing whether the true mean difference is less than zero. After subtracting, a test for a difference of two means with paired data is just like a test for one mean with $ $ unknown.</p>
<p>In the hypothesis test, we will refer to the variable representing the differences as <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. We will use this notation throughout the hypothesis test. For example, the true population mean will be labeled <span class="math inline">\(\mu_d\)</span> and the sample mean will be labeled <span class="math inline">\(\bar d\)</span>. The sample standard deviation of the differences is denoted <span class="math inline">\(s_d\)</span>.</p>

<p>[[<a href="File:Step1.png%7Clink" class="uri">File:Step1.png|link</a>=]]</p>
<p>‘’’Summarize the relevant background information’’’</p>
<p>Twenty-seven women participated in a nine week weight loss study. During the study period, the participants were provided a reduced calorie diet. Their weights were recorded at the beginning of the study and nine weeks later. The difference of the weights is defined as the post-study weights minus the pre-study weights. The researchers expected that the mean difference in the weights would be negative–in other words, that the women would tend to lose weight.</p>
<p>‘’’State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance’’’</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
H_0: &amp;~~ \mu_d=0 \\
H_a: &amp;~~ \mu_d &lt; 0
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>We will use the $ = 0.05 $ level of significance.</p>
<p>[[<a href="File:Step2.png%7Clink" class="uri">File:Step2.png|link</a>=]]</p>
<p>‘’’Describe the data collection procedures’’’</p>
<p>The women’s weights were recorded at the beginning of the study. The women were provided a reduced calorie diet for nine weeks. Then, their weights were measured again at the end of the study. A calibrated scale was used to provide an accurate weight.</p>
<p>[[<a href="File:Step3.png%7Clink" class="uri">File:Step3.png|link</a>=]]</p>
<p>‘’’Give the relevant summary statistics’’’</p>
<p>From the Excel output illustrated above, we get the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\bar d &amp;= -6.80 \\
s_d &amp;= 3.17 \\
n &amp;= 27 
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The mean and standard deviation are rounded to one decimal place more than the original data.</p>
<p>‘’’Make an appropriate graph (histogram) to illustrate the data’’’</p>
This histogram was created in Excel with seven bins:
<center>
[[<a href="File:Mahon-Histogram-Excel.png%7Clink" class="uri">File:Mahon-Histogram-Excel.png|link</a>=]]
</center>
<p>[[<a href="File:Step4.png%7Clink" class="uri">File:Step4.png|link</a>=]]</p>
<p>‘’’Verify the requirements have been met’’’</p>
<p>Like the one-sample t-test, this procedure is robust, meaning that it is not very sensitive to the requirements. If they are violated, it will probably still give reasonably good results.</p>
<p>The requirements for this procedure are the same as the requirements for a one-sample t-test: :* the data represent a simple random sample from the population :* the mean of the differences follows a normal distribution</p>

<p>From a practical perspective, it is impossible to get a simple random sample of people in the general population. When research trials are conducted, people must volunteer to participate. This can lead to a selection bias, but it is usually negligible.</p>

<p>‘’’Summarize the relevant background information’’’</p>
<p>Matched-pairs designs are not just used in pre- and post-test situations. They are often used in situations where it is not possible to randomly assign subjects to groups (for example, by a coin toss.) Nosocomial (pronounced: NO-suh-KOH-MEE-uhl) infections are infections that occur in hospitals, but are not a result of the original condition. An example of a nosocomial infection is when a heart attack patient develops a staph infection at the site of an IV injection. The infection was not caused by the heart attack, but it was acquired in the hospital. Nosocomial infections are very dangerous and may result in longer recovery times or increased death rates.</p>
<p>[[<a href="File:Pneumonia-CDC-5803.png%7Clink" class="uri">File:Pneumonia-CDC-5803.png|link</a>=|center|frame|This AP photo of a chest x-ray shows pneumonia of the left lower lobe of the lung. Pneumonia is an example of a possible nosocomial infection.<br />(Photo credit: Dr.Thomas Hooten, CDC)]]</p>
<p>Health care providers suspect that nosocomial infections increase the amount of time required to recover from an illness or injury. In controlled experiments, subjects (e.g., patients) are randomly assigned to treatments. However, it is not ethical to give patients a nosocomial infection in order to determine if it increases the duration of their hospital stay! At best, we can collect information on the duration of hospital stays for patients who acquire nosocomial infections and compare them to the duration of the stays for patients who do not.</p>
<p>There are many factors that affect the amount of time that a patient will need to stay in the hospital, including: nature of illness, types of procedures conducted, overall health, gender, age, etc. How can health care practitioners assess the effect of a nosocomial infection in the presence of so many other variables?</p>
<p>One way is to match a patient who develops a nosocomial infection with another one who has similar characteristics (illness, procedures, health, gender, age group, etc.) but does not develop a nosocomial infection. Now, the patients are matched into pairs with similar characteristics, where the principle difference between the members of each pair is whether or not they acquired a nosocomial infection.</p>
<p>By pairing the patients according to specific characteristics, the researchers can now subtract to observe a difference in their recovery times. In this way, it is possible to assess if nosocomial infections increase the mean duration of a hospital stay. Some researchers conducted such a study in which 52 pairs of patients were matched based on clinical characteristics. A patient with a nosocomial infection was matched as closely as possible to a similar case where there was no nosocomial infection. Patients who died were excluded from the study <!--<cite>Vegas93</cite>-->. The lengths of the hospital stays (in days) for these patients are given in the file <span class="Link">[[Data|NosocomialInfections]]</span>.</p>
<p>The difference, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, is defined as the duration of the hospital stay of the individual in the pair with the nosocomial infection minus the duration of the stay for the individual who did not get a nosocomial infection: <span class="math display">\[
Difference=Infected - NotInfected\]</span> After computing the differences, we do not use the data for the individual groups at all. In fact, after we subtract, the hypothesis test is conducted (essentially) like a one-sample test for a single mean with <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> unknown.</p>

<p>‘’’Summarize the relevant background information’’’</p>
<p>Obesity is a growing problem worldwide. Many scientists are seeking creative solutions to trim down this epidemic. Reduced energy expenditure is a potential cause of obesity.</p>
<p>Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) is defined as the amount of energy a person would use if resting for 24 hours. In essence, this is the amount of energy that a person’s body will consume if they do not do any physical activity. REE is measured in terms of kilo-Joules per day (kJ/d).</p>
<p>REE accounts for approximately 70 to 80% of all energy that a person will expend in a day. <!--<cite>Carlsson05</cite>--> If researchers can find simple, enjoyable activities that will increase REE, it may be possible to minimize the spread of obesity around the world.</p>
<p>Ebba Carlsson and other researchers in Sweden investigated whether listening to stressful classical music increases a person’s REE. <!--<cite>Carlsson05</cite>--> Each subject’s REE was measuring during silence and again while listening to stressful classical music. Data representing their results are given in the file <span class="Link">[[Data|REE-ClassicalMusic]]</span>.</p>
<p>Notice that this is not a pre- and post-test, but it is still a test involving paired data. Two REE measurements were made for each subject: (1) in silence (<span class="math inline">\(REE_1\)</span>) and (2) while listening to stressful classical music (<span class="math inline">\(REE_2\)</span>).</p>
<p>‘’’State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance’’’</p>
<p>Since we are testing for an increase in the mean REE, we let <span class="math inline">\(d = REE_2 - REE_1\)</span>. Our alternative hypothesis will be that $ _d &gt; 0 $. The null and alternative hypotheses are: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}

These trials were conducted in random order. Some of the subjects had the “silence” treatment first, and others had the “stressful” treatment first.</p>

<p>‘’’Summarize the relevant background information’’’</p>
<p>Pressures of supply and demand act directly on the prices for an airline ticket. As the seats available on the plane begin to fill, airlines raise the price. If seats on a flight do not sell well, an airline may discount the tickets or even cancel the flight. Business travelers frequently demand travel booked on short notice. They must pay the current price. Typically, tourists book their flights well in advance, hoping to buy tickets before the price rises. We will consider the cost of a one-way ticket from London’s Heathrow Airport to a variety of destinations in Europe.</p>
<p>Allie Henrich, a BYU-Idaho student, compared the lowest published ticket prices of one-way flights from Heathrow to various destinations in Europe. Using Travelocity.com, she recorded the lowest published fares for nonstop midweek flights booked either 14 days in advance or 90 days in advance. The prices (in US dollars) are given in the file <span class="Link">[[Data|DirectFlightCosts]]</span>. Notice that for some destinations, flights were not available.</p>
<p>The data are paired, because measuring the costs twice for each city. The 14-day ticket price is paired with the 90-day price for each city.</p>
<p>We will conduct a hypothesis test to determine if there is a difference in the cost of the nonstop flights when tickets are purchased 14 days in advance compared to 90 days in advance. We will use the 0.01 level of significance.</p>

<p>==Confidence Intervals==</p>
<p>We can compute a confidence interval for the true mean of the differences for paired data. After the differences between two paired data sets have been calculated, we can create a confidence interval for the true mean of the differences. To do this, we follow the instructions for creating a confidence interval for a one mean with $ $ unknown, but we use the column of differences as the data set.</p>
<p>{{Software_Filter|PageName=CI-PairedData}}</p>
<p>The requirements for creating a confidence interval for the difference of means are the same as the requirements for the hypothesis test. We assume: :* A simple random sample was drawn from the population :* The mean of the differences is normally distributed</p>

<p>Mountain pine beetles are small insects that bore into the bark of trees. The female beetles that first infest the tree emit pheromones to attract other beetles. In response to the pheromones, many beetles bore into the tree and ultimately kill it. The insects can destroy large tree stands within one year.</p>
<p>Lodgepole pine (‘’Pinus contorta’‘Dougl.ex Loud.) are particularly susceptible to mountain pine beetle (’‘Dendroctonus ponderosae’’ Hopkins) outbreaks. The image to the right shows the destruction that can be caused by these insects. The large brown patches are pines that have been killed by the beetles.</p>

<p>[[<a href="File:Step1.png%7Clink" class="uri">File:Step1.png|link</a>=]]</p>
<p>‘’’Summarize the relevant background information’’’</p>
<p>In William Sealy Gosset’s landmark paper on the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution, he cites data on a sleep-inducing drug. In a paper published in 1905, Arthur R. Cushny and A. Roy Peebles reported the effect of Lævorotary Hyoscyamine Hydrobromate (L-Hyoscyamine) on the length of time that people sleep before waking. <!-- cite{Cushny05} --> The primary research question is: does L-Hyoscyamine impact the mean amount of time that people sleep? We will compute a 90% confidence for the true mean difference in the times.</p>
<p>[[<a href="File:Step2.png%7Clink" class="uri">File:Step2.png|link</a>=]]</p>
<p>‘’’Describe the data collection procedures’’’</p>
<p>Eleven subjects were included in the study. At the start of the study, the researchers observed the average length of time that each of the participants slept before waking. Later, each subject was given 0.6 mg of L-Hyoscyamine and the duration of uninterrupted sleep was again measured.</p>
<p>The difference in the amount of time each person slept was computed by subtracting the amount of time the subjects slept when taking the drug minus the sleep duration with no drug. The data are summarized in the table below.</p>
<p>{| class=“basic” |+‘’’Mean hours of sleep’’’ |- ! Subject !! Control (no drug) !! L-Hyoscyamine !! Difference |- align=“center” | 1 || 0.6 || 1.3 || 0.7 |- align=“center” | 2 || 3 || 1.4 || -1.6 |- align=“center” | 3 || 4.7 || 4.5 || -0.2 |- align=“center” | 4 || 5.5 || 4.3 || -1.2 |- align=“center” | 5 || 6.2 || 6.1 || -0.1 |- align=“center” | 6 || 3.2 || 6.6 || 3.4 |- align=“center” | 7 || 2.5 || 6.2 || 3.7 |- align=“center” | 8 || 2.8 || 3.6 || 0.8 |- align=“center” | 9 || 1.1 || 1.1 || 0 |- align=“center” | 10 || 2.9 || 4.9 || 2 |- align=“center” | 11 || - || 6.3 || - |}</p>
<p>Notice that the “control” data for Subject #11 is missing. It is not possible to compute a difference for this person, so their data will be omitted from our analysis. For this analysis, we will use the remaining $ n=10 $ observations.</p>
