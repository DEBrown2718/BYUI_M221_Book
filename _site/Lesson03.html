<h2>Shape of a Distribution</h2>
<p><strong>Cost to Treat Tuberculosis in India</strong></p>
<p><img src="./Images/Market_rural-India_-Tamilword22.jpg|300px"></p>
<p><img src="Images/Step1.png"></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Design the study.</strong></p>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is the most deadly bacterial disease in the world. In 2009, nine million new cases of tuberculosis were diagnosed, leading to almost 2 million deaths worldwide. Currently, the principal vaccine used to prevent tuberculosis is Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG). Unfortunately, BCG is only moderately effective at preventing tuberculosis. Historically, India has had a high number of tuberculosis cases. The Indian Government wants to reduce the prevalence of this disease.</p>
<p>In this activity, you will compare the “average” costs of treating a person who contracts tuberculosis to the costs of preventing a case of tuberculosis in India.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Step2.png"></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Collect data.</strong></p>
<p>Health Care records of tuberculosis patients in India were surveyed to estimate the cost to treat patients with tuberculosis. The following data are representative of the total costs (in US dollars) incurred by society in the treatment of 10 randomly selected tuberculosis patients in India.</p>
<center>
15,100     19,000     4,800     6,500     14,900     600     23,500     11,500     12,900     32,200
</center>
<p>These costs include health care treatment, time missed from work, and in some cases utility lost due to death.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Step3.png"></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Describe the data.</strong></p>
<div id="visualizing-quantitative-data-histograms" class="section level3">
<h3>Visualizing Quantitative Data: Histograms</h3>
<p>The following data are representative of the total costs (in US dollars) incurred by society in the treatment of 10 randomly selected tuberculosis patients in India.</p>
<center>
15,100     19,000     4,800     6,500     14,900     600     23,500     11,500     12,900     32,200
</center>
<p>To help us visualize these data, we will create a graph called a histogram. To make a histogram, we will divide the number line from 0 to 35,000 in seven equal parts. We will then count the number of data points in each of these intervals:</p>
<center>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>{</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
</tbody>
</table>
! Interval ! Number of Observations |- | At least 0 and less than 5,000 | 2 |- | At least 5,000 and less than 10,000 | 1 |- | At least 10,000 and less than 15,000 | 3 |- | At least 15,000 and less than 20,000 | 2 |- | At least 20,000 and less than 25,000 | 1 |- | At least 25,000 and less than 30,000 | 0 |- | At least 30,000 and less than 35,000 | 1 |}
</center>
<p>For each of these intervals, we draw a bar on the histogram. The width of the bars is determined by the width of the interval (5000 in this example). The height of the bars is equal to the number of observations that fall in each interval.</p>
<div class="stats A">

<p><br> After summarizing the data numerically and graphically, we are ready to make inferences about the population.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Step4.png"></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Make inferences.</strong></p>
<p>The historical total mean cost to society to treat a case of tuberculosis in India is known to be <nomathjax>$</nomathjax>13,800. To assess if the cost has increased, the null and alternative hypotheses are:</p>
<p>:<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>: The mean cost is equal to <nomathjax>$</nomathjax>13,800.</p>
<p>:<span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>: The mean cost is greater than <nomathjax>$</nomathjax>13,800.</p>
<p>Using the symbol for the population mean, we can rewrite the null and alternative hypotheses more simply as:</p>
<p>:<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\mu = \$13,800\)</span> :<span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\mu &gt; \$13,800\)</span></p>
<p>Recall, that the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is the probability that the data would be as extreme or more extreme than we observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A small <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value indicates that there is a lot of evidence against the null hypothesis. If the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is low, say, less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>It can be shown that the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is 0.460. (Later in the course, you will have the tools to do this computation.)</p>
<div class="QuestionsHeading">
Answer the following question:
</div>
<div class="Questions">
<p>:1. Based on the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value, would you reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis? Explain how you made this determination.</p>
<div style="clear:both">

</div>
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" data-collapsetext="Hide Solution" data-expandtext="Show Solution">
<p>::Fail to reject the null hypothesis. Since the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is large, there is not a lot of evidence against the null hypothesis. When the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is large, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to suggest that the mean cost is now greater than <nomathjax>$</nomathjax>13,800.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p><img src="Images/Step5.png"></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Take action.</strong></p>
<p>After making inferences, you take action. The motivation for conducting a study like this is usually to see if there is inflation in the costs.</p>
<div class="QuestionsHeading">
Answer the following question:
</div>
<div class="Questions">
<p>:2. Given that you failed to reject the null hypothesis, do you think the Government of India needs to take any special action to stop the increase in the cost to treat tuberculosis?</p>
<div style="clear:both">

</div>
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" data-collapsetext="Hide Solution" data-expandtext="Show Solution">
<p>::Answers may vary. – We fail to reject the null hypothesis. That means that we could not say that the true mean cost is not equal to <nomathjax>$</nomathjax>13,800. So, there is not enough evidence of inflation. There is no need to for the Government of India to take action.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p><span id="Shape"></span>One benefit of using a histogram is that it allows you to visualize the distribution of the data. A histogram illustrates the overall shape of the distribution of the data. The height of the bars show how many observations fall in that range.</p>
<p>We will describe the shape of the distribution of a data set using the following basic categories: symmetric, bell-shaped, skewed right, and skewed left. Additionally, we can label the shape of a distribution as uniform, unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal.</p>
<p>A distribution is symmetric if both the left and right side of the distribution appear to be roughly a mirror image of each other. A special symmetric distribution is a bell-shaped distribution. When data follow a Bell-shaped distribution, the histogram looks like a bell. Bell-shaped distributions play an important role in Statistics and will play a role in most of the future lessons.</p>
<p>A distribution is right-skewed if a histogram of the distribution shows a long right tail. This can occur if there are some very large outliers. A distribution is left-skewed if a histogram shows that it has a long tail to the left.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Lesson_2_Activity_2-3.JPG"></p>
<p>If a distribution has only one peak, it is said to be <strong>unimodal</strong>. The three distributions illustrated above are all unimodal distributions. Some people might argue that there are several peaks in the GPA data, so it should not be considered unimodal. Even though there are jagged bumps in the histogram, it is important to visualize the overall shape in the data. When interpreting a histogram, it can be helpful to blur your eyes and imagine the overall shape—after smoothing out the bumps. If the overall trend indicates that there is more than one bump, then we do not consider the distribution to be unimodal.</p>
<p>Some distributions have no distinct peak, others have more than one peak. When there is no distinct peak, and the histogram shows a relatively flat shape, we might say the data follow a <strong>uniform</strong> distribution. If there are two distinct peaks, a distribution is called bimodal. If there are more than two peaks, we refer to the distribution as <strong>multimodal</strong>.</p>

<h2>Center of a Distribution</h2>
<p><img src="Images/Step3.png"></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Describe the data.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes people talk about the “typical” BYU-Idaho student or the “average” waiting time for a bus. But what does it mean for something or someone to be “average?” How can we quantify what it means to be “typical” or “average?” In the example below, we will explore one way to define what “average” means.</p>
<p>When we talk about the “typical” or “average” value, we are essentially describing the center of a population. If we want to estimate the “average” costs to treat a tuberculosis patient, there are several ways we can do it.</p>
<div id="measuring-the-center-of-a-distribution" class="section level3">
<h3>Measuring the Center of a Distribution</h3>
<div id="mean" class="section level4">
<h4>Mean</h4>
<p>The sample mean or sample arithmetic mean is the most common tool to estimate the center of a distribution. It is referred to simply as the mean. It is computed by adding up the observed data and dividing by the number of observations in the data set.</p>
<p>In Statistics, important ideas are given a name. Very important ideas are given a symbol. The sample mean has both a name (mean) and a symbol (<span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span>).</p>
<p>You may have heard people refer to the sample mean as the “average.” The word “average” refers to any number that is used to estimate the center of a distribution. The mean, median and mode are all examples of averages. To avoid confusion in this course, the word “average” will not be used to describe the mean.</p>

<h3>Parameters and Statistics</h3>
<p>We only have data on the cost to treat ten randomly selected tuberculosis patients. This represents a random sample from the population. The sample obtained by the researchers depends on random chance. If the study was repeated and a new sample of ten patients was randomly drawn from all cases of tuberculosis in India, would we observe the same data values? Certainly not!</p>
<p>However, if we draw a random sample, we would expect the mean of the new sample to be somewhat close to the mean for our original sample. The sample mean, <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span>, is an estimate of the true mean of the population.</p>
<p>One of the primary purposes of collecting and analyzing data is to estimate the true mean of a population.Usually, we do not know what the true mean is, and we estimate it with the sample mean.</p>
<p>The sample mean is an example of a statistic. A statistic is a number that describes a sample. The true (usually unknown) population mean is an example of a parameter. A parameter is any number that describes a population.</p>
<p>An easy way to distinguish between a parameter and a statistic is to note the repetition in the first letters:</p>
<p>:<em><strong>P</strong>opulation <strong>P</strong>arameter – True (usually unknown) value describing a population :</em><strong>S</strong>ample <strong>S</strong>tatistic – Estimate of the population parameter obtained from a sample</p>
<p>In the example above, the sample mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> = <nomathjax><span class="math inline">\(&lt;/nomathjax&gt;14,100 is a statistic. Over the last few years, the total mean cost to treat tuberculosis in India has been &lt;nomathjax&gt;\)</span></nomathjax>13,800. This is considered a parameter.</p>
<p>Different symbols are used to distinguish between the sample mean (a statistic) and the population mean (a parameter). The symbol for the sample mean is <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span>. The symbol for the population mean is <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Perspective</strong></p>
<p>The mean cost to treat the ten tuberculosis patients in the sample was <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> = <nomathjax><span class="math inline">\(&lt;/nomathjax&gt;14,100. This number gives us some useful information. However, if this was all we were given, we would not be able to distinguish the data above from a situation where the cost for each of the ten patents was exactly &lt;nomathjax&gt;\)</span></nomathjax>14,100. Notice that if the cost for each patient was <nomathjax>$</nomathjax>14,100, the mean would be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar x=\frac{14100 + 14100 + 14100 + 14100 + 14100 + 14100 + 14100 + 14100 + 14100 + 14100}{10} =14,100\]</span></p>
<p>Even though measures of center are important, we need to consider the shape, center and spread of a distribution of data. When evaluating data, it is sometimes tempting to compute a mean but to avoid creating a histogram. This can lead to errant decisions based on a misunderstanding or incorrect transcription of data. If there is a transcription error in the data, it is sometimes easiest to detect it as an outlier in a histogram.</p>

<p>Researchers Jessica Meir and Paul Ponganis studied the characteristics of the northern elephant seal, <em>Mirounga angustirostris</em> (Meir, 2010). These seals have the ability to dive deep into the ocean. Researchers placed a thermistor (thermometer) and a backpack recorder on 13 different seals.</p>

<p><strong>Mass</strong></p>
<p>The data file <span class="Link">[[Data|DivingElephantSeals]]</span> contains the mass in kilograms (kg) of the seals. How do we describe the distribution of the masses of the seals?</p>
<p>Use the data in the column labeled “Mass (kg)” to create a histogram and calculate the descriptive statistics.</p>
<div class="stats A">
<p><strong>Your histogram should look like this (a title and axis label have been added here)</strong>:</p>

<p>Some of these statistics, such as the mean and median, should be familiar to you by now. In this section, you will learn about the standard deviation and the variance. Later in this reading assignment we will discuss the minimum, <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span>, median, <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span>, and the maximum.</p>
<p>The mean mass of the 13 seals is $ x = 195.2$ kg. (Note that this value was rounded with one more decimal place of accuracy compared to the raw data.) The mean is a measure of the <em>center</em> of the distribution.</p>
<p>There is a fairly large difference in the masses of the different seals. The smallest seal has a mass of 148 kg. The largest has a mass of 288 kg.</p>
<p>The <strong>standard deviation</strong> is a measure of the <em>spread</em> in the distribution. If the standard deviation is relatively small, then the data tend to be close together. If the standard deviation is relatively large, the data tend to be more spread out.</p>
<p>The standard deviation of the seals’ body mass is 45.8 kg. This number contains information from all the seals. If the seals’ masses had been more diverse, the standard deviation would be larger. If the seals were more uniform in their masses, then the standard deviation would have been smaller. If all the seals somehow had the same mass, then the standard deviation would be zero.</p>
<p>We are working with a sample. To be explicit, we call 45.8 kg the <em>sample standard deviation</em>. The symbol for the sample standard standard deviation is <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. This is a statistic. The parameter representing the population standard deviation is $ $ (pronounced /SIG-ma/). In practice, we rarely know the value of the population standard deviation, so we use the sample standard deviation $ s $ as an approximation for the unknown population standard deviation $ $.</p>
<p>At this point, you probably do not have much intuition regarding the standard deviation. We will use this statistic frequently. By the end of the semester, you can expect to become very comfortable with this idea. For now, all you need to know is that if two variables are measured on the same scale, the variable with values that are further apart will have the larger standard deviation.</p>
<p><strong>Man Vs. Seal</strong></p>
<!-- http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/bodyfat -->
<p>Roger Johnson compiled a collection of measurements on 252 men. The mean mass of the men was $ x = 81.2 $ kg. The standard deviation of the weights was $ s = 13.3 $ kg.</p>
<p>The mean and standard deviation of the masses are in both cases smaller for the men than the the seals. This says that seals are generally larger than men and vary more in their weights. We compare these two distributions in the following histogram:</p>
<center>
Weights of Men Compared to Weights of Seals<br> <img src="Images/DiveSealsVsMenWeights-Hist.png">
</center>
<p>The mean mass of the men is less than the mean mass of the seals. We can see this, because the bulk of the data in the histogram for the men’s masses is to the left of the seals’. You will also note that the masses of the seals are more spread out than the masses of the men.</p>

<p>Consider the last column in the table of data. The “representative temperature” is the mean body temperature of the seal right before a new dive begins. The researchers were very interested in this information. One of the key things they studied was the change in the body temperature of the seals as they dove. They wanted to know if a decrease in their body temperature allows seals to dive for longer periods of time. It was important for them to establish a baseline temperature for each seal.</p>

<h4>Calculating the Standard Deviation by Hand</h4>
<p>How is the standard deviation computed? Where does this “magic” number come from? How does one number include the information about the spread of all the points?</p>
<p><strong>Bird Flu Fever</strong> <img src="Images/Peuquito.jpg"> Avian Influenza A H5N1, commonly called the bird flu, is a deadly illness that is currently only passed to humans from infected birds. This illness is particularly dangerous because at some point it is likely to mutate to allow human-to-human transmission. Health officials worldwide are preparing for the possibility of a bird flu pandemic.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Step1.png"></p>
<p>Dr. K. Y. Yuen led a team of researchers who reported the body temperatures of people admitted to Chinese hospitals with confirmed cases of Avian Influenza. Their research team collected data on the body temperature at the time that people with the bird flu were admitted to the hospital. In the article, they reported on two groups of people, those with relatively uncomplicated cases of the bird flu and those with severe cases.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Step2.png"></p>
<p>The table below presents the data representative of the body temperatures for the two groups of bird flu patients:</p>

<p>::Answers will vary. The difference between the largest and the smallest degree is 1.6 degrees. Most students will likely identify these observations as being relatively close together. There is not a huge spread in the temperatures.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>Think about the points you marked in question 5 above. On your sketch of the number line, draw a vertical line at 38.8 degrees, the sample mean. Now, draw horizontal lines from the mean to each of your <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>’s. These horizontal line segments represent the spread of the data about the mean. Your plot should look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="Images/BirdFlu-DotPlotAnswer-Lines.png"></p>
<p>The length of each of the line segments represents how far each observation is from the mean. If the data are close together, these lines will be fairly short. If the distribution has a large spread, the line segments will be longer. The standard deviation is a measure of how long these lines are, as a whole. It is a little tedious to compute the standard deviation by hand. However, the process is very instructive. As you work through the following steps, please remember the goal is to find a measure of the spread in a data set. We want one number that describes how spread out the data are.</p>
<p>The deviation of an observation from the mean is the directed distance from the observation to the mean. In other words, deviations are the lengths of the line segments you drew in the previous set of questions.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{1cl}
\text{Deviation} &amp; = &amp; \text{Value} - \text{Mean} \\
\text{Deviation} &amp; = &amp; x - \bar x
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>If the observed value is greater than the mean, the deviation is positive. If the value is less than the mean, the deviation is negative.</p>
<p>The standard deviation is a complicated sort of average of the deviations. Making a table like the one below will help you keep track of your calculations. Please participate fully in this exercise. Writing your answers at each step and to developing a table as instructed will greatly enhance the learning experience. By following these steps, you will be able to compute the standard deviation by hand.</p>
<p><strong>Step 01</strong>: The first step in computing the standard deviation by hand is to create a table, like the following. Enter the observed data in the first column.</p>

<p>:::You should have found that the mean of the deviations is zero. This is true for <em>every</em> data set.

The sum of the deviations from the mean will be zero, so the mean also must equal zero. :::The good news is that you can use this fact to check if you are on the right track. If the deviations from the mean do not add up to zero, then you have made a mistake in the calculations. The bad news is that the deviations always add up to 0, making it look like the distance from the data to the mean is 0.

<h4>Summary</h4>
<div class="Emphasis">
<p>:<strong>Standard Deviation</strong></p>
<p>:The <strong>standard deviation</strong> is one number that describes the spread in a set of data. If the data points are close together, the standard deviation will be smaller than if they are spread out.</p>
<p>:At this point, it may be difficult to understand the meaning and usefulness of the standard deviation. For now, it is enough for you to recognize the following points: ::* The standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the data are. ::* If the standard deviation is large, then the data are very spread out. ::* If the standard deviation is zero, then all the values are the identical–there is no spread in the data. ::* The standard deviation cannot be negative.</p>
</div>
<p><span id="Variance"><strong>Variance</strong></span></p>
<p>The variance is the square of the standard deviation. The sample variance is denoted by the symbol <span class="math inline">\(s^2\)</span>. The sample standard deviation for the GPAs in the histogram above is $ s = 0.663 $. So, the sample variance for this data set is $s^2 = 0.663^2 = 0.440 $. <!-- [[NEED TO DISCUSS STATISTIC v. PARAMETER.]] --></p>
<p>The standard deviation and variance are two commonly used measures of the spread in a data set. Why is there more than one measure of the spread? The standard deviation and the variance each have their own pros and cons.</p>
<p>The variance has excellent theoretical properties. It is an unbiased estimator of the true population variance. That means that if many, many samples of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> observations were drawn, the variances computed for all the samples would be centered nicely around the true population variance, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>. Because of these benefits, the variance is regularly used in higher-level statistics applications. One drawback of the variance is that the units for the variance are the square of the units for the original data. In the bird flu example, the body temperatures were measured in degrees Centigrade. So, the variance will have units of degrees Centigrade squared <span class="math inline">\((^\circ \text{C})^2\)</span>. What does degrees Centigrade squared mean? How do you interpret this? It doesn’t make any sense. This is one of the major drawbacks of the sample variance.</p>
<p>Because we take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation, the standard deviation is in the same units as the original data. This is a great advantage, and is one of the reasons that the standard deviation is commonly used to describe the spread of data.</p>
<p>Neither the standard deviation nor the variance is <strong>resistant</strong> to outliers. This means that when there are outliers in the data set, the standard deviation and the variance become artificially large. It is worth noting that the mean is also not resistant. When there are outliers, the mean will be “pulled” in the direction of the outliers.</p>
<p>The mean and standard deviation are used to describe the center and spread when the distribution of the data is symmetric and bell-shaped. If a data are not symmetric and bell-shaped, we typically use the five-number summary (discussed below) to describe the spread, because this summary is resistant.</p>
<p><strong>Review of Parameters and Statistics</strong></p>
<p>We have now learned some statistics that can be used to estimate population parameters. For example, we use $ x $ to estimate the population mean $ $. The sample statistics <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> estimates the true population standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. The following table summarizes what we have done so far:</p>

Since we do not know the true mean (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>,) we use the sample mean (<span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span>,) to estimate it. Typically, the data will be closer to <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> than to <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> was computed using the data. To compensate for this, we divide by <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> when we find the “average” of the squared deviations from the mean. It turns out, that subtracting 1 from <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> inflates this average by the precise amount needed to compensate for the use of <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> as an estimate for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. As a result, the sample variance (<span class="math inline">\(s^2\)</span>) is a good estimator of the population variance (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>.)</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong> of this process is “<strong>Describe the data</strong>.” The following information on percentiles, quartiles, 5-number summaries, and boxplots will help you learn common ways to describe data.</p>
<p><strong>Wrong Site/Wrong Patient Lawsuits</strong></p>
<p><img src="Images/Step3.png"></p>
<p>For symmetric, bell-shaped data, the mean and standard deviation provide a good description of the center and shape of the distribution. The mean and standard deviation are not sufficient to describe a distribution that is skewed or has outliers. An <strong>outlier</strong> is any observation that is very far from the others. The mean is “pulled” in the direction of the outlier. Also, the standard deviation is inflated by points that are very far from the mean.</p>
<p>Percentiles can be used to describe the center and spread of any distribution and are particularly useful when the distribution is skewed or has outliers. To explore this issue, you will use software to calculate percentiles of data on costs incurred by hospitals due to certain lawsuits. The lawsuits in question were about surgeries performed on the wrong patient, or on the right patient but the wrong part of the patient’s body (the wrong site).</p>
<p>Now, you have probably had some experience with percentiles in the past—especially when you received a score on a standardized test such as the ACT. Even though percentiles are commonly used, they are generally misunderstood. Before examining the wrong site/wrong patient data, let’s review percentiles. Even if you think you understand percentiles, please study this section carefully.</p>
<div id="percentiles-and-quartiles" class="section level3">
<h3>Percentiles and Quartiles</h3>
<p>Imagine a very long street with houses on one side. The houses increase in value from left to right. At the left end of the street is a small cardboard box with a leaky roof. Next door is a slightly larger cardboard box that does not leak. The houses eventually get larger and more valuable. The rightmost house on the street is a huge mansion.</p>
<div class="QuestionsHeading">
Answer the following question:
</div>
<div class="Questions">
<p>:21. There are 100 homes with increasing property values. How many fences are needed to separate the 100 properties?</p>
<div style="clear:both">

</div>
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" data-collapsetext="Hide Solution" data-expandtext="Show Solution">
<p>::In order to separate the 100 homes, 99 fences are required.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>The home values are representative of data. If we have a list of data, sorted in increasing order, and we want to divide it into 100 equal groups, we only need 99 dividers (like fences) to divide up the data. The first divider is as large or larger than 1% of the data. The second divider is as large or larger than 2% of the data, and so on. The last divider, the 99<sup>th</sup>, is the value that is as large or larger than 99% of the data. These “dividers” are called percentiles. A <strong>percentile</strong> is a number such that a specified percentage of the data are at or below this number. For example, the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile is a number such that 99% of the data are at or below this value. As another example, half (50%) of the data lie at or below the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile. The word “percent” means “<span class="math inline">\(\div 100\)</span>.” This can help you remember that the percentiles divide the data into 100 equal groups.</p>
<p><strong>Quartiles</strong> are special percentiles. The word “quartile” is from the Latin <em>quartus</em>, which means “fourth.” The quartiles divide the data into four equal groups. The quartiles correspond to specific percentiles. The first quartile, Q<sub>1</sub>, is the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile. The second quartile, Q<sub>2</sub>, is the same as the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile or the median. The third quartile, Q<sub>3</sub>, is equivalent to the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile.</p>

<h3>The Five-Number Summary</h3>
<p>Another way to summarize data is with the five-number summary. <strong>The five-number summary</strong> is comprised of the minimum, the first quartile, the second quartile (or median), the third quartile and the maximum. The values in the five-number summary are <em>always</em> presented in this order. Since the order of the numbers in the five number summary is fixed, it is not necessary to label each of the values individually.</p>
<p>Statistical packages can give different results for some computations. This is because there are several reasonable ways to define certain quantities, such as the quartiles. As such, you may find that some of the values that are given in {{Course_Filter|course=A|content=Excel}}<!--{{Course_Filter|course=B C|content=SPSS}}--> are different than what other software may give. <!--Please be sure to use the values that you calculate using the software designated for your particular class ({{Course_Filter|course=A|content=Excel}}{{Course_Filter|course=B C|content=SPSS}}-->.</p>

<div id="boxplots" class="section level3">
<h3>Boxplots</h3>
<p>A <strong>boxplot</strong> is a graphical representation of the five-number summary. Unlike the mean or standard deviation, a boxplot is resistant to outliers. That means that it won’t be “pulled” one way or the other by extraordinarily large or small values in the data as will a mean, for instance. We will illustrate the process of making a boxplot using the wrong-site data.</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to learn how to draw a boxplot.</p>
<p>:<strong>Step 01:</strong> To draw a boxplot, start with a number line.</p>
<p>:<img src="Images/Lesson_2_Activity_6_BoxPlot_1.jpg"></p>
<p>:<strong>Step 02:</strong> Draw a vertical line segment above each of the quartiles. :<img src="Images/Lesson_2_Activity_6_BoxPlot_2.jpg"></p>
<p>:<strong>Step 03:</strong> Connect the tops and bottoms of the line segments, making a box. :<img src="Images/Lesson_2_Activity_6_BoxPlot_3.jpg"></p>
<p>:<strong>Step 04:</strong> Make a smaller mark above the values corresponding to the minimum and the maximum. :<img src="Images/Lesson_2_Activity_6_BoxPlot_4.jpg"></p>
<p>:<strong>Step 05:</strong> Draw a line from the left side of the box to the minimum, and draw another line from the right side of the box the maximum. :<img src="Images/Lesson_2_Activity_6_BoxPlot_5.jpg"></p>
<p>:<strong>Step 06:</strong> These last two lines look like whiskers, so this is sometimes called a box-and-whisker plot.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>*A ’‘’histogram’’’ allows us to visually interpret data. Histograms can be left-skewed, right-skewed, or symmetrical and bell-shaped.</p>
<p>*The ’‘’mean’’‘,’‘’median’’‘, and’‘’mode’’’ are measures of the center of a distribution. The mean is the most common measure of center, and is computed by adding up the observed data and dividing by the number of observations in the data set.</p>
<p>*The ’‘’standard deviation’’’ is a number that describes how spread out the data are. A larger standard deviation means the data are more spread out than data with a smaller standard deviation.</p>
<p>*A ’‘’parameter’’’ is a true (but usually unknown) number that describes a population. A ’‘’statistic’’’ is an estimate of a parameter obtained from a sample.</p>
<p>*’‘’Quartiles/percentiles’’‘,’‘’Five-Number Summaries’’‘, and’‘’Boxplots’’’ are tools that help us understand data. The five-number summary of a data set contains the minimum value, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum value. A boxplot is a graphical representation of the five-number summary. <br></p>
