A study was conducted in Austria to determine if the likelihood that a child will have hay fever (seasonal allergies) is different for children living in rural communities compared to children who live in a city. The researchers surveyed `r n1rural` children who lived in rural communities and found that `r x1rural` suffered from hay fever. Among the `r n1city` children who lived in the city, `r x1city` reported that they had hay fever. Use this information to answer questions 1 through 4.

1. Create side-by-side pie charts to illustrate this data.  


2. Verify that the requirements are met to create a confidence interval.


3. Construct and interpret a `r confLevel1`% confidence interval for the difference in the proportions of city children with hay fever and rural children with hay fever.

4. Is zero contained in the confidence interval? What does this mean?

```{r,include=FALSE}

phat2G2 = x2G2/n2G2

n2Total = n2G1 + n2G2

confLevel2 = 95
alpha2 = 1 - (confLevel2/100)
zStar2 = zStar(confLevel1)

condition2_1G1 = n2G1 * phat2G1
condition2_2G1 = n2G1 * (1 - phat2G1)

condition2_1G2 = n2G2 * phat2G2
condition2_2G2 = n2G2 * (1 - phat2G2)

reqMet2 = ConditionsMetPropConf(min(c(condition2_1G1,condition2_2G1)),min(c(condition2_1G2,condition2_2G2)))
#reqMet2 = ConditionsMetTwoProp(condition2_1G1,condition2_2G1,condition2_1G2,condition2_2G2)

On April 12, 1955, Dr. Jonas Salk released the results of clinical trials for his vaccine to prevent polio.  In these clinical trials, `r formatC(n2Total,big.mark=",",format="fg")` children were randomly divided into two groups.  The subjects in Group 1 were given the vaccine, while the subjects in Group 2 were given the placebo.  Of the `r formatC(n2G1,big.mark=",",format="fg")` children in Group 1 (the vaccine group), `r x2G1` children developed polio.  Of the `r formatC(n2G2,big.mark=",",format="fg")` children in Group 2 (the placebo group), `r x2G2` children developed polio. Use this information to answer questions 5 and 6. 

5. Verify that the requirements are met to create a confidence interval.


6. Construct and interpret a `r confLevel2`% confidence interval for the difference in the proportions of children who received the vaccine and contracted polio and children who received the placebo and contracted polio.  Please round your answers to five decimal places.

Historically, studies have shown that men are more likely to cheat in school than women. A study was conducted at four public universities to determine the accuracy of this claim. In an anonymous survey, a group of students was asked if they had ever cheated in college. Among the men, `r x3Men` out of `r n3Men` reported that they had cheated at least once in college. Among the women, `r x3Women` out of `r n3Women` females reported that they had cheated at least once. Use this information to test the hypothesis that men are more likely to cheat in college than women. Use a level of significance of $\alpha=`r alpha3`$.  For this hypothesis test, let group 1 represent men and group 2 represent women. Use this information to answer questions 7 through 15.

7. Create a bar chart or pie chart to illustrate this data. 

8. Verify that the requirements are met to perform a hypothesis test. 

9. State the null and alternative hypotheses.

10. Give the value of $\hat{p}_1$ $\hat{p}_2$.
 
11. Give the test statistic and its value.

12. Calculate the P-value based on the test statistic.

13. Label the test statistic and shade the P-value on a sampling distribution curve.

14. What decision do you make based on the P-value and the level of significance ($\alpha$)? 

15. State your conclusion in an English sentence.

16. How would your answer change if the hypothesis test was a 2-sided test?

```{r,include=FALSE}
x4Clarinex = 50
n4Clarinex = 1655
phat4Clarinex = x4Clarinex/n4Clarinex

x4Placebo = 31
n4Placebo = 1652
phat4Placebo = x4Placebo/n4Placebo

phat4 = (x4Clarinex + x4Placebo)/(n4Clarinex+n4Placebo)

confLevel4 = 95
alpha4 = 1 - (confLevel4/100)

condition4_1Clarinex = n4Clarinex * phat4Clarinex
condition4_2Clarinex = n4Clarinex * (1 - phat4Clarinex)

condition4_1Placebo = n4Placebo * phat4Placebo
condition4_2Placebo = n4Placebo * (1 - phat4Placebo)

zScore4 = zTwoProp(phat4,phat4Clarinex,phat4Placebo,n4Clarinex,n4Placebo)
pValue4 = pnorm(zScore4, lower.tail = FALSE)*2
```


In clinical trials of the allergy medicine Clarinex, it was reported that `r x4Clarinex` out of `r n4Clarinex` individuals in the Clarinex group and `r x4Placebo` out of `r n4Placebo` individuals in the placebo group experienced dry mouth as a side effect of their respective treatments.  Is there a difference in the proportions of those who had dry mouth between the two groups?  Use a level of significance of $\alpha = `r alpha4`$. For this hypothesis test, let group 1 represent the subjects on Clarinex and group 2 represent the subjects on placebo. Use this information to answer questions 16 through 23.

17. Verify that the requirements are met to perform a hypothesis test. 

18. State the null and alternative hypotheses.

19. Give the value of $\hat{p}_1$ $\hat{p}_2$.

20. Give the test statistic and its value.

21. Calculate the P-value based on the test statistic.

22. Label the test statistic and shade the P-value on a sampling distribution curve.

23. What decision do you make based on the P-value and the level of significance ($\alpha$)? 

24. State your conclusion in an English sentence.
