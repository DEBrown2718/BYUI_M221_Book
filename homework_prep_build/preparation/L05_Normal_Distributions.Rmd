## Problems

**Part I:**  Use the information in the reading assignment to complete these questions.

```{r,include=FALSE}
trueMean = .261
trueSD = .034

x1A = .190
zA = (x1A - trueMean)/trueSD
x1B = .225
zB = (x1B - trueMean)/trueSD
x1C = .325
zC = (x1C - trueMean)/trueSD
x1D = .335
zD = (x1D - trueMean)/trueSD

x2 = .335
probx2 = pnorm(((x2 - trueMean)/trueSD),lower.tail = FALSE)
```

   
1.	Classify each of the following batting averages as either "unusual" or "not unusual." Use the z-score to make this determination.
	
    a. `r x1A`

	  b. `r x1B`

	  d. `r x1D`

2. Find the probability that a randomly selected professional baseball player will have a batting average that is greater than `r x2`. 

3. Provide a brief description of a Normal Density Curve. Describe the shape and the properties. 

4. In the following z-score formula, $z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$ please state what each symbol stands for.

5. In no less than three sentences, please define and describe the 68-95-99.7% rule.

**Part II:**

    c. If a student's score is the $`r percentile6_c`^{th}$ percentile, what would their corresponding z-score be?

    d. What is the quantitative GRE score for a student who scores at the $`r percentile6_c`^{th}$ percentile?

7. The mean speed of hydrogen at room temperature is `r MeanHyd` m/s with a standard deviation of `r SDHyd` m/s. 

    a. At room temperature the mean speed of hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) particles is approximately normal with a population mean of $\mu$ = ________ meters per second (m/s) and a standard deviation of 
$\sigma$ = ________ m/s.  

    b. What is the probability that a randomly selected particle has a speed over `r x7_b` m/s?

    c. What is the probability that a randomly selected particle has a speed that is less than `r x7_b` m/s?

    d. What is the probability that a randomly selected particle has a speed that is less than `r x7_d` m/s? 

    e. What is the probability that a randomly selected particle has a speed that is between `r x7_d` and `r x7_b` m/s? 

    f. What is the $`r quartile7_f`^{rd}$ quartile of the speeds of hydrogen at room temperature?

8. Determine whether the data represented in these histograms are normally distributed or not. Record your answer for each graph.  Justify your answer.
