<div class="Summary">
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>null hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>)</strong> is the foundational assumption about a population and represents the status quo. It is a statement of equality (<span class="math inline">\(=\)</span>). The <strong>alternative hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>)</strong> is a different assumption about a population and is a statement of inequality (<span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(\ne\)</span>). Using a <strong>hypothesis test</strong>, we determine whether it is more likely that the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis is true.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong><span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value</strong> is the probability of getting a test statistic at least as extreme as the one you got, assuming <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is true. A <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is calculated by finding the area under the normal distribution curve that is more extreme (farther away from the mean) than the z-score. The alternative hypothesis tells us whether we look at both tails or only one.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>level of significance (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>)</strong> is the standard for determining whether or not the null hypothesis should be rejected. Typical values for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> are <span class="math inline">\(0.05\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.10\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(0.01\)</span>. If the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is less than <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> we reject the null. If the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is not less than <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> we fail to reject the null.</p></li>
<li>A <strong>Type I error</strong> is committed when we reject a null hypothesis that is, in reality, true. A <strong>Type II error</strong> is committed when we fail to reject a null hypothesis that is, in reality, not true. The value of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the probability of committing a Type I error. <br></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<div class="RecapHeading">
Lesson 10 Recap
</div>
<div class="Summary">
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>margin of error</strong> gives an estimate of the variability of responses. It is calculated as <span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle{m=z^*\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(z^*\)</span> represents a calculated z-score corresponding to a particular confidence level.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>confidence interval</strong> is an interval estimator used to give a range of plausible values for a parameter. The width of a confidence interval depends on the chosen confidence level (and its corresponding value of <span class="math inline">\(z^*\)</span>) as well as the sample size (<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>). This is the equation for calculating confidence intervals: <span class="math display">\[\displaystyle{\left(\bar x-z^*\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}},~\bar x+z^*\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)}\]</span></p></li>
<li>The <strong>sample size formula</strong> allows us to estimate the number of observations required to obtain a specific margin of error. <span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle{n=\left(\frac{z^*\sigma}{m}\right)^2}\)</span> <br></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<div class="RecapHeading">
Lesson 11 Recap
</div>
<div class="Summary">
<ul>
<li><p>In practice we rarely know the true standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> and will therefore be unable to calculate a z-score. <strong>Student’s t-distribution</strong> gives us a new test statistic, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, that is calculated using the sample standard deviation (<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>) instead. <span class="math display">\[ \displaystyle{ t = \frac {\bar x - \mu} {s / \sqrt{n}} } \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution is similar to a normal distribution in that it is bell-shaped and symmetrical, but the exact shape of the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution depends on the <strong>degrees of freedom (<span class="math inline">\(df\)</span>)</strong>. <span class="math display">\[df=n-1\]</span></p></li>
<li>You will use Excel to carry out hypothesis testing and create confidence intervals involving <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distributions. <br></li>
</ul>

<div class="RecapHeading">
Lesson 12 Recap
</div>
<div class="Summary">
<ul>
<li><p>The key characteristic of <strong>dependent samples</strong> (or <strong>matched pairs</strong>) is that knowing which subjects will be in group 1 determines which subjects will be in group 2.</p></li>
<li><p>We use slightly different variables when conducting inference using dependent samples:</p>
<p>Group 1 values: <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>  Group 2 values: <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>  Differences: <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>  Population mean: <span class="math inline">\(\mu_d\)</span>  Sample mean: <span class="math inline">\(\bar d\)</span>  Sample standard deviation: <span class="math inline">\(s_d\)</span></p></li>
<li>When conducting hypothesis tests using dependent samples, the null hypothesis is always <span class="math inline">\(\mu_d=0\)</span>, indicating that there is no change between the first population and the second population. The alternative hypothesis can be left-tailed (<span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>), right-tailed(<span class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span>), or two-tailed(<span class="math inline">\(\ne\)</span>). <br></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<div class="RecapHeading">
Lesson 13 Recap
</div>
<div class="Summary">
<ul>
<li><p>In contrast to dependent samples, two samples are independent if knowing which subjects are in group 1 tells you nothing about which subjects will be in group 2. With <strong>independent samples</strong>, there is no pairing between the groups.</p></li>
<li><p>When conducting inference using independent samples we use <span class="math inline">\(\bar x_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> for the mean, standard deviation, and sample size, respectively, of group 1. We use the symbols <span class="math inline">\(\bar x_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span> for group 2.</p></li>
<li><p>When working with independent samples it is important to graphically illustrate each sample separately. Combining the groups to create a single graph is not appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p>When conducting hypothesis tests using independent samples, the null hypothesis is always <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1=\mu_2\)</span>, indicating that there is no difference between the two populations. The alternative hypothesis can be left-tailed (<span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>), right-tailed(<span class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span>), or two-tailed(<span class="math inline">\(\ne\)</span>).</p></li>
<li>Whenever zero is contained in the confidence interval of the difference of the true means we conclude that there is no significant difference between the two populations. <br></li>

<p>*<strong>ANOVA</strong> is used to compare the means for several groups. The hypotheses for the test are always: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
H_0: &amp; ~ \textrm{All the means are equal} \\
H_a: &amp; ~ \textrm{At least one of the means differs}
\end{align}

<ul>
<li><p>For ANOVA testing we use an <strong><span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-distribution</strong>, which is right-skewed. The <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value of an ANOVA test is always the area to the right of the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-statistic.</p></li>
<li>We can conduct ANOVA testing when the following three requirements are satisfied:</li>

<p>Researchers at the University of Mississippi wanted to determine whether the reaction time (in seconds) to go/no go stimulus of males differed from that of females. The researchers randomly selected 20 females and 15 males to participate. The go/no go stimulus required the student to respond to a particular stimulus and not to respond to other stimuli. Use this information to answer questions 2 and 3.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The researchers decided to construct a confidence interval to determine if the difference of the means is significant. To determine whether the confidence interval would be reliable they create Q-Q plots of both random samples and see that they are approximately normal. Are the requirements for constructing a confidence interval satisfied? Why or why not?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Yes. The distribution of the mean for each sample is normal since the researchers can apply the Central Limit theorem.</li>
<li>Yes. The distribution of the mean of each sample is normal since the data have been determined to be normal.<br />
</li>
<li>No. The distribution of the mean of each sample is not normal since the sample size is not large enough.</li>

Even though the sample is small, the null hypothesis would be rejected at the 0.05 significance level. Consequently, she rejects the null hypothesis.

<p>Many studies have suggested that there is a link between exercise and healthy bones. Exercise stresses the bones and this causes them to get stronger. One study examined the effect of jumping on the bone density of growing rats. There were three groups (rats were selected at random for the three groups): a control with no jumping, a low-jump group (the jump height was 30 centimeters), and a high-jump group (60 centimeters). After 8 weeks of 10 jumps per day, 5 days per week, the bone density of the rats (expressed in mg/cm3) was measured. The rats were selected at random for the three groups. Researchers would like to perform a hypothesis test to determine if the mean levels of bone density are different between the three different groups of rats listed above.

<p>Pressures of supply and demand act directly on the prices for an airline ticket. As the seats available on the plane begin to fill, airlines raise the price. If seats on a flight do not sell well, an airline may discount the tickets or even cancel the flight. A study was undertaken to determine if there is a difference in the mean cost of an airline ticket purchased 90 days in advance of a scheduled flight compared with a ticket purchased only 14 days in advance. Data were collected on the cost of a one-way ticket from London’s Heathrow Airport to a variety of destinations in Europe. The lowest published ticket prices of one-way flights from Heathrow to various destinations in Europe was recorded for each scheduled flight 90 days in advance and then again 14 days in advance. Perform a hypothesis test to determine if there is a difference in the cost of the nonstop flights when tickets are purchased 14 days in advance compared to 90 days in advance.
