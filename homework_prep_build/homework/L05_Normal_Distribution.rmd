**Instructions:  You are encouraged to collaborate with other students on the homework, but it is important that you do your own work.  Before working with someone else on the assignment, you should attempt each problem on your own.** 

1.	Based on the following histogram, how would you classify the distribution of the data?
   
    a.  We can conclude that the data are normal.
    b.	We can conclude that the data are not normal.
    
```{r, echo=FALSE,cache.vars=TRUE}

The data set [NASDAQ Price and Volume](../../Data/NASDAQ-PriceAndVolume.xlsx) summarizes information on select companies that are traded on NASDAQ.  The table gives the symbol for the company, the company's name, the price of their stock and the number of shares that have been traded (the volume).  Use this information to answer question 3.

4.	Under normal circumstances, a density curve can drop below the X-axis.

    a.	True
    b.	False

    b.	86% of all data values fall within two standard deviations of the mean.
    c.	95% of all data values fall within two standard deviations of the mean.
    d.	99.7% of all data values fall within two standard deviations of the mean.

9.	The time to complete a standardized exam in the BYU-Idaho Testing Center is approximately normal with a mean of `r mean1` minutes and a standard deviation of `r sd1` minutes. Using the 68-95-99.7 rule, approximately what percentage of students will complete the exam in less than one hour?  (Give your answer as a percent.) _________% 

10. According to the histogram plot below, the data are ... (finish the sentence)

```{r,include=FALSE}
mean2 = 74.45
sd2 = 4.41
x2 = 60.56
z2 = (x2 - mean2)/sd2

11.	An observation was drawn from a normally distributed population with mean `r mean2` and standard deviation `r sd2`.  If the observed value is `r x2`, find the z-score.  Give your answer accurate to 3 decimal places. z = _________    

```{r,include=FALSE}
z3 = 2.9
```

12.	Shoe sizes for men in the United States are known to follow a normal distribution. If you calculated the z-score of a man's shoe size and found the z-score to be `r z3`, what would you conclude about his shoe size?

The SAT and the ACT are both aptitude tests designed to measure students' readiness for college.  They are different tests with separate scoring systems, but they measure the same abilities.  The highest score possible on the SAT Mathematics section is `r max4SAT`.  The distribution of SAT scores is normal with mean `r mean4SAT` and standard deviation `r sd4SAT`.  The highest score possible on the ACT Mathematics section is `r max4ACT`.  ACT scores are normally distributed with mean `r mean4ACT` and standard deviation `r sd4ACT`.  Use this information to answer questions 13 and 14.  
   
13.	Eleanor scores `r x4Eleanor` on the Mathematics part of the SAT.  Gerald takes the ACT Mathematics test and scores `r x4Gerald`.  Calculate the z-scores for each student.    

  Eleanor's z-score: __________ Gerald's z-score: ___________    

14.	Assuming that both tests measure the same kind of ability, who did better in the Mathematics section? Explain your answer.  

```{r,include=FALSE}
LabelWeight5 = 87.75
mean5 = 90
sd5 = 0.75

betweenLow = mean5 - 2 * sd5
betweenHigh = mean5 + 2 * sd5

z5_q16 = (LabelWeight5 - mean5)/sd5
proportion5_q16 = pnorm(z5_q16, lower.tail = T)

x5_q17 = 91.3
prob5_q17 = pnorm(((x5_q17 - mean5)/sd5),lower.tail = FALSE)

percentile5_q18 = 66
z5_q18 = qnorm(percentile5_q18/100,lower.tail = TRUE)
x5_q18 = z5_q18 * sd5 + mean5
```

The label on the ChocoLux candy bar states that it has a net weight of `r LabelWeight5` grams.  Due to the natural variability in the manufacturing process, the chocolate bars do not all weigh exactly `r LabelWeight5` grams.  In fact, the distribution of weights is approximately normal with a mean of `r mean5` grams and a standard deviation of `r sd5` grams. Use this information to answer questions 15 through 19.  

15.	Complete this sentence.  About 95% of the ChocoLux candy bars will be between.

    a.	89.25 and 90.75 grams.
    b.	`r betweenLow` and `r betweenHigh` grams.
    c.	87.75 and 92.25 grams.
    d.	87 and 93 grams.  

16.	What proportion of the bars actually weigh less than `r LabelWeight5` grams?  In other words, what proportion of the customers is getting less candy than they should? Give your answer accurate to 3 decimal places. (Use the applet) _________ 

17.	What is the probability that the weight of a randomly selected candy bar will be greater than `r x5_q17` grams? Give your answer accurate to 3 decimal places. [(Use the applet)](http://byuimath.com/apps/normprob.html) _________  

18.	What is the `r percentile5_q18`th percentile of weights of ChocoLux bars?  Give your answer accurate to 3 decimal places. _________  

19.	What does it mean that the weight of a ChocoLux candy bar is at the `r percentile5_q18`th percentile?
