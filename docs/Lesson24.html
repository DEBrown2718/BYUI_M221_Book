<p><strong>Here are the summaries for each lesson in unit 4. Reviewing these key points from each lesson will help you in your preparation for the exam.</strong></p>
<div class="RecapHeading">
Lesson 21 Recap
</div>
<div class="Summary">
<ul>
<li><p>Creating <strong>scatterplots</strong> of bivariate data allows us to visualize the data by helping us understand its <strong>shape</strong> (linear or nonlinear), <strong>direction</strong> (positive, negative, or neither), and <strong>strength</strong> (strong, moderate, or weak).</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>correlation coefficient (<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>)</strong> is a number between <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> that tells us the direction and strength of the linear association between two variables. A positive <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> corresponds to a <strong>positive association</strong> while a negative <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> corresponds to a <strong>negative association</strong>. A value of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> closer to <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> indicates a stronger association than a value of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> closer to zero.</p></li>
<li>The <strong>covariance</strong> is a measure of how two variables vary together. The formula for the covariance is <span class="math inline">\(s_{xy}=r \cdot s_x \cdot s_y\)</span>. <br></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<div class="RecapHeading">
Lesson 22 Recap
</div>
<div class="Summary">
<ul>
<li><p>In statistics, we write the <strong>linear regression equation</strong> as <span class="math inline">\(\hat Y=b_0+b_1X\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span> is the <strong>Y-intercept</strong> of the line and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> is the <strong>slope</strong> of the line. The values of <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> are calculated using software.</p></li>
<li><p>Linear regression allows us to predict values of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> for a given <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. This is done by first calculating the coefficients <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> and then plugging in the desired value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and solving for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p></li>
<li>The <strong>independent (or explanatory) variable (<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>)</strong> is the variable which is <em>not</em> affected by what happens to the other variable. The <strong>dependent (or response) variable (<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>)</strong> is the variable which <em>is</em> affected by what happens to the other variable. For example, in the correlation between number of powerboats and number of manatee deaths, the number of deaths is affected by the number of powerboats in the water, but not the other way around. So, we would assign <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to represent the number of powerboats and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> to represent the number of manatee deaths. <br></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<div class="RecapHeading">
Lesson 23 Recap
</div>
<div class="Summary">
<ul>
<li><p>The unknown <strong>true linear regression line</strong> is <span class="math inline">\(Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> is the true y-intercept of the line and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is the true slope of the line.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>residual</strong> is the difference between the observed value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> for a given <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and the predicted value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> on the regression line for the same <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. It can be expressed as: <span class="math display">\[
Residual = Y - \hat Y = Y - (b_0 + b_1 X)
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>To check all the requirements for bivariate inference you will need to create a <strong>scatterplot</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, a <strong>residual plot</strong>, and a <strong>Q-Q plot of the residuals</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>We conduct a hypothesis test on bivariate data to know if there is a linear relationship between the two variables. To determine this, we test the slope (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>) on whether or not it equals zero. The appropriate hypotheses for this test are: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{1cl}
H_0: &amp; \beta_1=0 \\
H_a: &amp; \beta_1\ne0
\end{array}
\]</span></p></li>
<li>For bivariate inference we use software to calculate the sample coefficients, residuals, test statistic, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value, and confidence intervals of the true linear regression coefficients. <br></li>

Future questions:

5. Weight gain during pregnancy of the mother is an important indicator of infant health. A simple random sample of pregnant women on Egypt, Kenya, and Mexico was used to determine if weight gain during pregnancy differed in these three countries. Which hypothesis test would be most appropriate for this analysis?

8. Oâ€™Hare International Airport in Chicago has a reputation for having a large proportion of its flights being late. You design a study to see if this reputation is deserved. You find that the average on-time rate for all international airports in the US is 70%. You collect data and determine the on-time rate for Oâ€™Hare. You decide to construct a confidence interval to compare Oâ€™Hareâ€™s on-time rate to the national average. Which confidence interval would be most appropriate for this study?

<li>An investor with a stock portfolio worth several hundred thousand dollars sued his broker and brokerage firm because he felt that lack of diversification in his portfolio led to poor performance for many years in a row. In an effort to avoid close public scrutiny, the firm agreed to settle the conflict by an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel compared a sample of 39 months of the investor’s returns with the average of the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index for the same period in order to determine whether there was a substantial difference. The S&amp;P has a known population mean return of 0.95. Suppose that you are a member of this arbitration panel.
