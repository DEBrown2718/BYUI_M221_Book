==What If We Don't Know $\sigma$?==

[[File:WilliamSealyGosset-NoCopyright.png|link=|thumb|right|'''Historical Note:''' <br> William Sealy Gosset (1876-1937) was a British industrial scientist and statistician best known for his discovery of the $t$-distribution. <!-- Gosset was able to focus on statistics after he was confined to his bed for three months because of a motor accident ...he ran into a lamp-post on a straight road, by looking down to adjust some stuff he was carrying... His statistical work was motivated by his research for the brewery that employed him much of his life.--> ]]

In practice, we almost never know the population standard deviation, $ \sigma $.  So, it is generally not appropriate to use the formula
$$
z = \frac{ \bar x - \mu }{ \sigma / \sqrt{n} }
$$
In 1908, William Sealy Gosset published a solution to this problem <!--<cite>Gosset08</cite>-->.  He found a way to appropriately compute the confidence interval for the mean when $\sigma$ is not known.  The basic idea is to use the sample standard deviation, $s$ in the place of the true population standard deviation, $\sigma$.  If $\sigma$ is not known, we cannot base the calculations on the standard normal distribution, and we cannot use the formula above to conduct hypothesis tests.

In a remarkable piece of work, Gosset found the appropriate distribution to use when $\sigma$ is unknown. At the time of this discovery, Gosset worked for the Guinness brewery.  To avoid problems with industrial espionage, Guinness prohibited employees from publishing any research results.  Knowing his work provided a significant contribution to Statistics, Gosset chose convinced his employer to allow him to publish under a pseudonum.  He chose the pseudonym "Student".  Gosset's test statistic was denoted by the letter $t$, this distribution has come to be known as '''Student's t-distribution'''.

$$
t = \frac{ \bar x - \mu }{ s / \sqrt{n} }
$$

The $t$-distribution is bell-shaped and symmetrical.  The $t$-distribution has a mean of 0, but it has more area in the tails than the standard normal distribution.    The exact shape of the $t$-distribution depends on a parameter called the '''degrees of freedom''' (abbreviated $df$).  The degrees of freedom is related to the sample size.  As the sample size goes up, the degrees of freedom increase accordingly.  For the procedures discussed in this lesson, the degrees of freedom equal the sample size minus one: $df = n-1$.

[http://byuimath.com/apps/normprobwitht.html Click here] to explore how the shape of the $t$-distribution changes with the degrees of freedom.  Notice that as the degrees of freedom increases, the shape of the $t$-distribution (black curve) gets closer to the standard normal distribution (red curve).  The red curve is identical in the three images below.

==Hypothesis Tests==


[[File:StepsAll.png|link=|center]]

===Body Temperatures Revisited===

We will apply the $t$-distribution to the body temperature data we explored previously.  

This hypothesis test is conducted in a manner similar to a test for a single mean where $\sigma$ is known, except that instead of using the population standard deviation, $\sigma$, in the calculations, we estimate this value using the sample standard deviation, $s$.  This leads to a $t$-distribution, rather than a normal distribution for the test statistic. We will not need to compute the value of this test statistic by hand.  It will be done using Software.


[[File:Step1.png|link=]]

'''Summarize the relevant background information'''

We want to conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the mean body temperature is different from 98.6&deg; Fahrenheit.  Previously, we assumed that we knew the value of $\sigma$.  Actually, this value is not known.

'''State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance'''

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
H_0: \mu = 98.6\\
H_a: \mu \ne 98.6\\
\end{array}
$$
$$
\alpha = 0.05
$$


[[File:Step2.png|link=]]

'''Describe the data collection procedures'''

We will use the body temperature data, <span class=Link>[[Data|BodyTemp]]</span>, collected by Dr. Mackowiak and his colleagues to conduct the test. <!-- <cite>Mackowiak92</cite> -->


[[File:Step3.png|link=]]

'''Give the relevant summary statistics'''

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\bar x = 98.23\\
s = 0.738\\
n = 148
\end{array}
$$

'''Make an appropriate graph (e.g. a histogram) to illustrate the data'''

[[File:BodyTemp-Histogram-LoRes.png|link=|center]]


[[File:Step4.png|link=]]
  
'''Verify the requirements have been met'''

:*We assume that the individuals chosen to participate in the study represent a (simple) random sample from the population.
:*$\bar x$ will be normally distributed, because the sample size is large.  (Note: We could have also noticed that the body temperature data appears to be normally distributed, so even with a small sample size, $\bar x$ would be normal.)
        
'''Give the test statistic and its value'''

We will need to conduct the analysis using software, so we can report this value.

'''Instructions for conducting a test for one mean with $sigma$ unknown:'''

<!-- To access this content, scroll to the bottom of the editing page and click on the link "Software:(Excel or SPSS)-(PageName)" -->
{{Software_Filter | PageName=OneSampleTtest }}

The interpretation of the results will follow the pattern established in the previous hypothesis tests.  If the $P$-value is less than the $\alpha$ level, we reject the null hypothesis. If the $P$-value is greater than the $\alpha$ level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.  This is true for every hypothesis test.

The test statistic is $t$ and its value is $-6.029$.  So, we have $t = -6.029$.

Notice this is the same number we get if we use the formula:
$$
\begin{align}
t &= \frac{ \bar x - \mu }{ s / \sqrt{n} } \\
&\approx \frac{ 98.234 - 98.6 }{ 0.738 / \sqrt{148} } \\
&\approx -6.03
\end{align}
$$
Any differences are due to rounding.

'''State the degrees of freedom'''

{{Course_Filter|course=A|content=In Excel, the degrees of freedom ($df$) are given in cell E21.}}

$$df = 147$$
<!-- '''Mark the test statistic and $P$-value on a graph of the sampling distribution''' --> <!-- CONSOLIDATED and UPDATED -->

'''Find the $P$-value and compare it to the level of significance'''

The $P$-value is given in the software as "1.2723E-08".  Writing this properly and comparing it to $\alpha$, we have:
$$
P\text{-value} = 1.2723 \times 10^{-8} = 0.000~000~012~723 < 0.05 = \alpha
$$

'''State your decision'''

The interpretation of the results will follow the pattern established in the previous hypothesis tests.  If the $P$-value is less than the $\alpha$ level, we reject the null hypothesis. If the $P$-value is greater than the $\alpha$ level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.  This is true for every hypothesis test.  

Since the $P$-value was less than $\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis.


[[File:Step5.png|link=]]

'''Present your conclusion in an English sentence, relating the result to the context of the problem'''

There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the mean body temperature is not 98.6&deg; Fahrenheit.

===Baby Boom===


[[File:Step1.png|link=]]

'''Summarize the relevant background information'''

The birth weight of a child is an important indicator of their neonatal health.  It is important that pediatric health care providers track changes in the birth weights over time.  The birth weight of children in Australia has historically had a population mean of 3373 grams.<!--<cite>Steele97,JSEdunn99</cite>-->  Is this still the mean birth weight of Australian children, or has there been a change?  We will use the 0.05 level of significance.

'''State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance'''

$$
\begin{align}
H_0: &~ \mu=3373 \\
H_a: &~ \mu \ne 3373
\end{align}
$$
$$ \alpha = 0.05 $$


[[File:Step2.png|link=]]

'''Describe the data collection procedures'''

The birth weights of all children born on December 18, 1997 at the Mater Mothers' Hospital in Brisbane, Australia were recorded <!--<cite>JSEdunn99</cite>-->.  The time of birth (on a 24 hour clock), gender, and birth weight of each child are given in the file <span class=Link>[[Data|BabyBoom]]</span>.

Using this data set, test the hypothesis that the mean weight of babies born in Australia is 3373 grams. Use the $\alpha=0.05$ level of significance for this problem.  Make an appropriate graph of the data.

There is insufficient evidence to suggest that the mean weight of babies born in Australia is different from 3373 grams.

==Confidence Intervals==

The procedure for finding confidence intervals when $\sigma$ is not known is very similar to the process when $\sigma$ is known. As a reminder, here is the confidence interval (from Lesson 10) when $\sigma$ is known.
$$
\left( \bar x - z^* \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}, ~ \bar x + z^* \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right)
$$

To construct the confidence interval when $\sigma$ is not known, we replace the population standard deviation, $\sigma$, with its point estimate, $s$. The appropriate distribution is a $t$, rather than a $z$.  So, we replace $z^*$ with $t^*$. So the confidence interval when $\sigma$ is not known is
$$
\left( \bar x - t^* \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}, ~ \bar x + t^* \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right)
$$
where $t^*$ is the $t$-score corresponding to the confidence level and $s$ is the sample standard deviation.

We will use {{Name}} to construct confidence intervals when $\sigma$ is unknown. The values of $t^*$ and $s$ will be computed for us. Examples of this are given below. You can see the details by clicking on [Show Hand Calculations] in Step 4.

===Automatic Language Translation Programs===


[[File:Step1.png|link=]]

'''Summarize the relevant background information'''

Computer software is commonly used to translate text from one language to another.  As part of his Ph.D. thesis, Philipp Koehn developed a phrase-based translation program called Pharaoh. <!--<cite>Koehn04Pharaoh</cite>-->

The quality of the translation can vary.  A good translation system should match a professional human translation. <!--<cite>Papineni02</cite>--> It is important to be able to quantify how good the translations produced by Pharaoh are.

The IBM T. J. Watson Research Center developed methods to measure the quality of a translation from one language to another. <!--<cite>Brown90</cite>-->  One of these is the the BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU). <!--<cite>Papineni02</cite>--> BLEU is a score ranging from 0 to 1 that indicates how well a computer translation matches a professional human translation of the same text.  Higher scores indicate a better match. BLEU helps companies who develop translation software "to monitor the effect of daily changes to their systems in order to weed out bad ideas from good ideas". <!--<cite>Papineni02</cite>-->


[[File:Step2.png|link=]]

'''Describe the data collection procedures'''

To test Pharaoh's ability to translate, Koehn took a random sample of 100 blocks of Spanish text, each of which contained 300 sentences, and used Pharaoh to translate each of these to English.  The BLEU score was calculated for each of the 100 blocks.  The data were extracted from Figure 2 in a paper Koehn published. <!--<cite>Koehn04</cite>-->  The 100 BLEU scores are given in <span class=Link>[[Data|BLEU-Scores]]</span>.

Koehn wants to find an estimate of the true mean BLEU score for text translated by the Pharaoh computer program.  He would like to compute a confidence interval, but he does not know the true population standard deviation, $\sigma$.


[[File:Step3.png|link=]]

'''Give the relevant summary statistics'''

<!-- To access this content, scroll to the bottom of the editing page and click on the link "Software:(Excel or SPSS)-(PageName)" -->
{{Software_Filter | PageName=BLEUscores-SummaryStats }}

The summary statistics are:

$$
\begin{align}
\bar x =& 0.2876 \\ 
s =& 0.0264 \\
n =& 100
\end{align}
$$

'''Make an appropriate graph to illustrate the data'''

Here is a histogram of the data showing 10 bins.

[[File:BLEUscores-Histogram-Excel.png|link=|center]]


[[File:Step4.png|link=]]

'''Verify the requirements have been met'''

The requirements for creating a confidence interval for a mean with $\sigma$ unknown are the same as the requirements for this procedure when $\sigma$ is known:

====Requirements====

There are two requirements that need to be checked when computing a confidence interval for a mean with $\sigma$ unknown:

:1. A simple random sample was drawn from the population
:2. $ \bar x$ is normally distributed

Recall the requirement of normality is satisfied if the data are approximately normally distributed or if the sample size is large.

The data are bell-shaped and fairly symmetric.  So, the sample mean, $\bar x$, is approximately normally distributed.  

'''Find the confidence interval'''

<div style="clear:both"></div>
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" data-collapsetext="Hide Hand Calculations" data-expandtext="Show Hand Calculations">
The formula for the confidence interval where $\sigma$ is known was given in the reading titled [[Lesson 10: Inference for One Mean: Sigma Known (Confidence Interval)|Inference for One Mean: Sigma Known (Confidence Interval)#11:CIformula-SigmaKnown|Lesson 10: Inference for One Mean: Sigma Known (Confidence Interval)|Inference for One Mean: Sigma Known (Confidence Interval)]] as
$$
\left( \bar x - z^* \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}, ~ \bar x + z^* \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right)
$$ 
It is impossible to know the true standard deviation of the BLEU scores for a new translation program like Pharaoh. Replacing $\sigma$ with $s$ and replacing $z^*$ with $t^*$, we get:
$$
\left( \bar x - t^* \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}, ~ \bar x + t^* \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right)
$$ 
The value of $t^*$ depends on the level of confidence and the sample size.  It must be computed using software or looked up on a table.  If you are asked to compute a confidence interval for a mean where the population standard deviation is unknown, the value of $t^*$ will be given to you.  The other numbers ($\bar x$, $s$, and $n$) can all be obtained directly from your data.

If we want to create a 95% confidence interval for $\mu$, with 99 degrees of freedom, then $ t^* = 1.9842 $.

Using the sample statistics:
$$
\begin{align}
\bar x =& 0.2876 \\ 
s =& 0.0264 \\
n =& 100
\end{align}
$$

The 95% confidence interval for $\mu$ is:
$$
\left( 0.2876 - 1.9842 \frac{0.0264}{\sqrt{100}}, ~ 0.2876 + 1.9842 \frac{0.0264}{\sqrt{100}} \right)
$$ 
which reduces to:
$$
\left( 0.2824, ~ 0.2928 \right)
$$

<!-- To access this content, scroll to the bottom of the editing page and click on the link "Software:(Excel or SPSS)-(PageName)" -->

The 95% confidence interval for the true mean BLEU score is:

$$ (0.282, 0.293) $$

'''Present your observations in an English sentence, relating the result to the context of the problem'''
