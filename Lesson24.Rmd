**Here are the summaries for each lesson in unit 4. Reviewing these key points from each lesson will help you in your preparation for the exam.**

<div class="RecapHeading">Lesson 21 Recap</div>
<div class="Summary">

- Creating **scatterplots** of bivariate data allows us to visualize the data by helping us understand its **shape** (linear or nonlinear), **direction** (positive, negative, or neither), and **strength** (strong, moderate, or weak). 

- The **correlation coefficient ($r$)** is a number between $-1$ and $1$ that tells us the direction and strength of the linear association between two variables. A positive $r$ corresponds to a **positive association** while a negative $r$ corresponds to a **negative association**. A value of $r$ closer to $-1$ or $1$ indicates a stronger association than a value of $r$ closer to zero.

- The **covariance** is a measure of how two variables vary together. The formula for the covariance is $s_{xy}=r \cdot s_x \cdot s_y$.
<br>
</div>
<br>

<div class="RecapHeading">Lesson 22 Recap</div>
<div class="Summary">

- In statistics, we write the **linear regression equation** as $\hat Y=b_0+b_1X$ where $b_0$ is the **Y-intercept** of the line and $b_1$ is the **slope** of the line. The values of $b_0$ and $b_1$ are calculated using software.

- Linear regression allows us to predict values of $Y$ for a given $X$. This is done by first calculating the coefficients $b_0$ and $b_1$ and then plugging in the desired value of $X$ and solving for $Y$. 

- The **independent (or explanatory) variable ($X$)** is the variable which is *not* affected by what happens to the other variable. The **dependent (or response) variable ($Y$)** is the variable which *is* affected by what happens to the other variable. For example, in the correlation between number of powerboats and number of manatee deaths, the number of deaths is affected by the number of powerboats in the water, but not the other way around. So, we would assign $X$ to represent the number of powerboats and $Y$ to represent the number of manatee deaths.
<br>
</div>
<br>

<div class="RecapHeading">Lesson 23 Recap</div>
<div class="Summary">

- The unknown **true linear regression line** is $Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X$ where $\beta_0$ is the true y-intercept of the line and $\beta_1$ is the true slope of the line.

- A **residual** is the difference between the observed value of $Y$ for a given $X$ and the predicted value of $Y$ on the regression line for the same $X$. It can be expressed as:
$$
Residual = Y - \hat Y = Y - (b_0 + b_1 X)
$$

- To check all the requirements for bivariate inference you will need to create a **scatterplot** of $X$ and $Y$, a **residual plot**, and a **Q-Q plot of the residuals**. 

- We conduct a hypothesis test on bivariate data to know if there is a linear relationship between the two variables. To determine this, we test the slope ($\beta_1$) on whether or not it equals zero. The appropriate hypotheses for this test are:
$$
\begin{array}{1cl}
H_0: & \beta_1=0 \\
H_a: & \beta_1\ne0
\end{array}
$$

- For bivariate inference we use software to calculate the sample coefficients, residuals, test statistic, $P$-value, and confidence intervals of the true linear regression coefficients.

2. Students in an Introductory Statistics class at BYU-Idaho were studying prices of cold cereal at grocery stores in Rexburg. To get a sample of cold cereal prices, they went to Albertson's and rolled a die to decide which box from the left of the top shelf they would start on. They then recorded every 6th cereal after the first, moving from left to right down the shelves, recording the name, size, and price of each cereal in their sample. Is this study an experiment or an observational study, and why?

    a. An experiment, because the students had control over which sampling method they used
    b. An experiment, because the students had control over which cereals would be selected for the study
    c. An observational study, because the students had no control over the price of the individual cereals
    d. An observational study, because the students had no control over which cereals were selected

11. Marine biologists have been studying the effects of acidification of the oceans on weights of male baluga whales in the Arctic Ocean. One of the studies involves a random sample of 16 baluga whales. The researchers want to create a 95% confidence interval to estimate the true mean weight of male baluga whales. Their data follow a normal distribution. The population standard deviation of weights of male baluga whales is $\sigma = 125 ~\text{kg}$, and the researchers feel comfortable using this standard deviation for their confidence interval.Are the requirements for the use of a confidence interval met? Explain.

    a. Yes. The distribution of sample means is normal because the data are normal.
    b. Yes. The distribution of sample means is normal because the sample size is large.
    c. No. The distribution of sample means is not normal because the sample size is small.
    d. No. The fact that the data are normal does not imply that the distribution of sample means is normal.

12. An investor with a stock portfolio worth several hundred thousand dollars sued his broker and brokerage firm because he felt that lack of diversification in his portfolio led to poor performance for many years in a row.  In an effort to avoid close public scrutiny, the firm agreed to settle the conflict by an arbitration panel.  The arbitration panel compared a sample of 39 months of the investor's returns with the average of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for the same period in order to determine whether there was a substantial difference. The S&P has a known population mean return of 0.95.  Suppose that you are a member of this arbitration panel.  Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the investor's portfolio performed significantly worse than the performance of the S&P 500.  Use a level of significance of $\alpha=0.05$. Open the data file Rates of Return.  What is the $P$-value for this test? Give your answer accurate to three decimal places. (Example: 0.034)

13. A financial economist is studying married couples in which both spouses work. He wants to compare the mean income earned by husbands with the mean income earned by their wives. Should he use independent sampling or dependent sampling, and why?

    a. Independent sampling. The two spouses are separate people with different jobs, so the husband's income doesn't depend on his wife's income.
    b. Independent sampling. How he selects the husband is independent of how he selects the wife.
    c. Dependent sampling. The husband's income depends to some degree on his wife's income.
    d. Dependent sampling. He needs to select couples for his sample, so whether a particular wife is included depends on whether her husband is included.

Pressures of supply and demand act directly on the prices of airline tickets. As the seats available on the plane begin to fill, airlines raise the price. If seats on a flight do not sell well, an airline may discount the tickets or even cancel the flight. Allie Henrich, a BYU-Idaho student, wanted to determine if there is a difference in the price of tickets listed 90 days before a flight compared with 14 days before the same flight. For her study she compared the prices of one-way flights from London's Heathrow Airport to various destinations in Europe. Using Travelocity.com, she recorded the lowest published fares for 90 nonstop midweek flights 90 days in advance and then found the lowest published price for the same destination again 14 days in advance. The prices (in US dollars) are given in the file DirectFlightCosts. Notice that for some destinations, flights were not available. Use this information to answer the next two questions.

<br>

14. What is the $P$-value for this test? Round your answer to 3 decimal places. (Example: 0.045)

<br>

15. Based on the results of the test, can you say that there is a difference in the cost of airline tickets purchased 90 days in advance compared with 14 days in advance? Use a level of significance of $\alpha=0.05$.

    a. Yes, because the $P$-value was greater than the level of significance.
    b. Yes, because the $P$-value was lower than the level of significance.
    c. No, because the $P$-value was greater than the level of significance.
    d. No, because the $P$-value was lower than the level of significance.

16. A real estate company wants to evaluate two of their home appraisers for consistency in preparation for their annual state certification. It is important that different appraisers be able to give similar estimates for homes and other properties. The company selects a random sample of 10 homes in different neighborhoods around the city and independently asks each appraiser for an estimate of the home value. After they receive the estimates for each home, the company subtracts the value given by the first appraiser from the value given by the second appraiser. They create a Q-Q plot of the differences and see that the points in the plot roughly form a straight line. Are the requirements for using the desired confidence interval satisfied? Explain.

    a. Yes. The distribution of mean differences is normal because the sample size is large.
    b. Yes. The distribution of mean differences is normal because the data have been determined to be normal.
    c. No. The distribution of mean differences is not normal because the sample size is not large enough.
    d. Not necessarily, because the company needs to check that the values given by each appraiser are normal, not that the differences are normal.
    
<br>

17. Now suppose the company of the previous item wants to use a hypothesis test to determine whether the estimates given by the two appraisers are different. Which of the following would be the most appropriate pair of hypotheses for such a test?

    a. $H_0:~\mu_1 = \mu_2$ &nbsp;&nbsp; $H_a:~\mu_1 \ne \mu_2$
    b. $H_0:~\mu_1 \ne \mu_2$ &nbsp;&nbsp; $H_a:~\mu_1 = \mu_2$
    c. $H_0:~\mu_d = 0$ &nbsp;&nbsp; $H_a:~\mu_d \ne 0$
    d. $H_0:~\mu_d \ne 0$ &nbsp;&nbsp; $H_a:~\mu_d = 0$

18. Suppose you create a 95% confidence interval for a mean, and get (-2.346, 8.775). You've been told to report this by saying, "We are 95% confident that the true mean is between -2.346 and 8.775." Exactly what does this mean?

    a. There is a 95% chance that the true mean is between -2.346 and 8.775.
    b. 95% of all 95% confidence intervals actually contain the true mean.
    c. 95% of the data are between -2.346 and 8.775.
    d. 95% of the sample means are between -2.346 and 8.775.

20. Your little brother has a a career batting average of 0.233.  You want to determine the probability that he will have a batting average of over 0.250 next season when he will be up to bat 40 times. Are the conditions met so that the sample proportion $\hat p$ will be approximately normal?

    a. Yes. There is a large sample ($n>30$) so the sample proportion must be normal.
    b. Yes. $40\times0.250\ge10$ so the conditions are satisfied.
    c. No. $\hat p$ can only be normal if the sample data are normally distributed.
    d. No. $40\times0.233<10$ so the conditions are not satisfied.
    
<br>

21. A geneticist takes a simple random sample of $n = 140$ gamete (sex) cells from the testes of a dog to determine the proportion which contain the chromosomes for development into a male. Assume the (unknown) true proportion of dog gametes that contain the male chromosome is 46%. The geneticist conducts her sample and calculates $\hat p = 0.512$.

25. An study is planned to compare the proportion of men who dislike anchovies with the proportion of women who dislike anchovies. The study seeks to determine if the proportions of men and women who dislike anchovies are different. A sample of 41 men was taken and the $\hat p$ estimate for the true proportion of men who dislike anchovies was determined to be 0.67. A sample of 56 women was also taken and the $\hat p$ estimate for the true proportion of women who dislike anchovies was determined to be 0.84. Are the requirements satisfied to perform this hypothesis test? Why?

    a. Yes, because the sample sizes of both groups are greater than 5.
    b. Yes, because in both cases $n \hat p > 10$
    c. Yes, because we know that the populations are normally distributed.
    d. No, because the sample size for the women is too small.

26. A study was conducted to measure the effectiveness of a diet program that claims to help manage weight. Subjects were randomly selected to participate. Before beginning the program, each participant was given a score based on his or her fitness level. After six months of following the diet, each participant received another score. The study wanted to test whether there was a difference between before and after scores. What is the correct alternative hypothesis for this analysis?

    a. $\mu \ne 0$
    b. $\mu_d \ne 0$
    c. $\mu_1 \ne \mu_2$
    d. $p_1 \ne p_2$

27. Weight Watchers wanted to predict how much weight a client would lose if they followed a prescribed exercise program in addition to their diet program. Volunteers were randomly divided into two groups, one group dieted but didn't exercise, and the other group dieted and followed the exercise program. For the exercise group, they used linear regression with percent compliance with the exercise program as the explanatory variable and pounds lost in three months as the response variable. One of the clients was told that his residual was 5.5 pounds. What does this mean?

    a. His predicted weight loss was 5.5 pounds higher than his actual weight loss.
    b. His actual weight loss was 5.5 pounds higher than his predicted weight loss.
    c. His actual weight loss was 5.5 pounds higher than it would have been if he didn't exercise.
    d. His predicted weight loss was 5.5 pounds higher than it would have been if he didn't exercise.

Pressures of supply and demand act directly on the prices of airline tickets. As the seats available on the plane begin to fill, airlines raise the price. If seats on a flight do not sell well, an airline may discount the tickets or even cancel the flight. Allie Henrich, a BYU-Idaho student, WANTED TO PREDICT THE PRICE OF TICKETS 14 DAYS BEFORE A FLIGHT BASED ON THE PRICE OF TICKETS LISTED 90 DAYS BEFORE THE SAME FLIGHT. For her study she compared the prices of one-way flights from London's Heathrow Airport to various destinations in Europe. Using Travelocity.com, she recorded the lowest published fares for 90 nonstop midweek flights 90 days in advance and then found the lowest published price for the same destination again 14 days in advance. The prices (in US dollars) are given in the file DirectFlightCosts. Notice that for some destinations, flights were not available. Use this information to answer questions 3 through 37.

<br>

<br>

34. Give a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression line obtained when 90-Days-before-flight ticket prices are used to predict 14-Days-before-flight ticket prices. (Round your answers to three decimal places, Example: 23.445)

<br>

35. Choose the correct null and alternative hypotheses for this analysis.

    a. $H_0:~b_0 = 0$ &nbsp;&nbsp; $H_a:~b_0 \ne 0$

<br>

36. Give the value of the test statistic and the $P$-value. (Round your answers to three decimal places, Example: 0.567)

<br>

37. What decision do you make based on the $P$-value and the level of significance ($\alpha$), and, thus,  what do you conclude?

    a. Fail to reject the null. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the slope of the true linear regression line does not equal zero. We conclude that there is not a linear relationship between 14-day ticket prices and 90-day ticket prices.
    b. Fail to reject the null. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that the slope of the true linear regression line does not equal zero. We conclude that there is not a linear relationship between 14-day ticket prices and 90-day ticket prices.
    c. Reject the null. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the slope of the true linear regression line does not equal zero. We conclude that there is a linear relationship between 14-day ticket prices and 90-day ticket prices.
    d. Reject the null. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that that the the slope of the true linear regression line does not equal zero. We conclude that there is a linear relationship between 14-day ticket prices and 90-day ticket prices.

    a. One mean (sigma known)
    b. One mean (sigma unknown)
    c. Mean of the differences (paired samples)
    d. Difference of the means (independent samples)
    e. Several means (ANOVA)
    f. One proportion
    g. Difference of two proportions
    h. Chi-Squared test of independence
    i. Slope of the regression line

38. In the United States, mothers who live in poverty generally have babies with lower birthweight than those who do not live in poverty. The mean birthweight for babies born in the U.S. to mothers living in poverty is approximately 2800 grams. The CDC carries out a study to test the effectiveness of a new prenatal care program in reducing the number of low birthweight babies born. For the study, 30 mothers, all of whom live in poverty, participate in the program and birthweight data is recorded. Which hypothesis test would be most appropriate for this study?
